2021-01-12 John Elliott

	* psftools-1.1.0 released.
	* ams2psf, psf2ams: Now support SCRCHAR.JOY, the LocoScript screen 
	          font file.
	* psf2ams: A short .PSF font converted to a .COM file will now only
	          redefine those characters defined by the .PSF font.
	

2020-12-22 John Elliott

	* Support added for (internal and external) code page mappings
	 with more than 256 characters. The format of the .CP2 files used
	 to hold these mappings has been changed accordingly.
	* Codepage names are now matched case-insensitively.
	* New codepages: LS3 (LocoScript 3), QX10 (Epson QX-10) and PRINTIT 
	 (MML Systems Printit, a subset of QX10)
	* raw2psf: Bugfix: --codepage was not setting the Unicode mapping on 
		the last character in the font.
	* psf2ams: If passed an 8x16 font, the self-loading COM file now
		  loads it at full height on the PCW16 (and scales it down
		  on other computers).
	* psf2xbm: Added an --across option allowing the width of the output
	 bitmap to be changed (height is adjusted to match).

2020-12-07 John Elliott

	* psftools-1.0.14 released.

	* New programs: psf2ams and ams2psf, allowing generation of 
			self-loading fonts and/or custom EMS files for 
			Amstrad CP/M computers.

2019-07-05 John Elliott

	* psftools-1.0.13 released.

2019-05-17 John Elliott

	* zx2psf: Added 'move1' mode to zx2psf - like 'bare' but remaps the
	         pound and copyright to their ISO-8859-1 positions. [Damien 
		 Guard]

2019-03-19 John Elliott

	* psftools-1.0.12 released.

	* fnt2psf: Changed the Windows 1.x font extract to seek to the
	 character bitmap rather than assuming it directly follows the
	 widths table.

2017-03-17 John Elliott

	* cpi2psf: Was unable to parse LCD.CPI from Toshiba MS-DOS 3.30, 
		 which is slightly out of spec.
	* Updated GEM codepage now that there's a Unicode dingbat for 'bell'.
	 (U+1F514).

2012-01-81 John Elliott

	* loadpsf: Support for Wang PC colour and mono video cards. Does
		  not support 'CGDC' or 'IBM emulation' card types.

2010-11-14 John Elliott

	* Updated build scripts to a more recent autoconf / automake.

2009-05-03 John Elliott

	* loadpsf: Added support for Compaq Portable plasma displays.

2008-06-21 John Elliott

	* psftools-1.0.8 released.
	* psfs2mda: Created new utility to build an MDA character ROM image.
	* mda2psf: Added a --compaq option to match the --compaq option in
		psfs2mda(1).

2008-04-11 John Elliott

	* psftools-1.0.7 released.

	* Codepages: The PPCGREEK codepage had the two lower-case sigmas the
	 wrong way round. Various other corrections made to the PPCGREEK and
	 PPC860 codepages.

2008-01-26 John Elliott

	* psf2bbc: Converts a PSF font to a BBC Micro soft font.
	* bbc2psf: Reverses psf2bbc; converts a BBC Micro soft font to PSF.
	* The BBCMICRO codepage now covers characters 32-255.

2008-01-23 John Elliott

	* psftools-1.0.6 released.

2007-12-29 John Elliott

	* psf2bsd: Converts a PSF to a BSD 'wsfont' kernel header.

2007-06-20 John Elliott

	* wyse2psf: Reverses psf2wyse; converts a Wyses soft font to PSF.
	* psf2wyse: New utility to convert a PSF to a soft font that can be
		   uploaded into a Wyse-60 or compatible terminal.

2007-01-29 John Elliott

	* psftools-1.0.5 released.

	* Corrected some documentation problems.

2006-10-14 John Elliott

	* cpi2psf: Changed the CPI loader so that it tries to detect 
	 and accommodate codepages that contain segment:offset pointers 
	 rather than 32-bit offsets.

2006-07-04 John Elliott

	* codepages: Updated ISO-8859-7 to match the current unicode.org
	 mapping rather than the previous Linux one.

2006-06-20 John Elliott

	* codepages: More corrections to the 'amstrad' codepage.
	* psfxform: Corrected a crash which occurred if --strip and --psf1
	 were both applied to a Unicode PSF2.

2006-06-18 John Elliott

	* psftools-1.0.4 released.

2006-06-17 John Elliott

	* psfs2cpi: Added the ability to override what mapping is used
	for a numeric codepage.

2006-06-11 John Elliott

	* Example 'Fonts' directory added, showing examples of use.
	* codepages: Made the POSIX version capable of reading the .CP2
	files used by the DOS version, and of directly reading Unicode
	mapping tables in the .txt and .uni formats. This makes it possible
	to have user-created codepages.
	* codepages: Added page2cp2, which writes files in .CP2 format,
	either from a builtin codepage or from a .txt / .uni file.

2006-05-31 John Elliott

	* codepages: The generation program reacted badly to hyphens in 
	comments, causing several of the codepages (AMSTRAD, CP737, 
	CP850, CP858, CP863, CP865, CP866, PCGEM) to omit characters. 
	Corrected. 

2006-03-13 John Elliott

	* loadpsf: Added support for Hercules Graphics Card Plus, which can
	load up to 3072 8x14 characters. At the same time, allowed it
	to load up to 2048 characters into a VGA, though there is
	little practical use for either of these.

2006-02-26 John Elliott

	* psftools-1.0.3 released.

2006-02-25 John Elliott

	* cpi2psf: Made the --codepage option behave like --codepage in 
	other tools, so that when a codepage is extracted the characters in 
	it are in the same order as in the source file.
	* psfxform: Added --scale and --inverse options.
	* psfxform: Rewrote the character conversion engine. Added --centre
	option and support for applying options only to ranges of characters, 
	because you might want --repeat only to apply to graphics, for example.

2005-12-13 John Elliott

	* psftools-1.0.2 released.
	* psfxform: Added --double and --repeat options.
	* fnts2fon: MS-DOS version can use '_' instead of ' ' in the 
	   --fontid option.
	* codepages: Modified the maps for codepages 850,865,866 and 737 
	   so that character 0 maps to U+0000, not U+FFFD.

2005-10-31 John Elliott

	* Created four new codepages for the Amstrad PPC512 character ROM.
	 The standard codepages aren't quite suitable for converting this
	 ROM to a PSF, as they conflate different characters.  

2005-10-30 John Elliott

	* psftools-1.0.1 released.

2005-10-28 John Elliott
	
	* Created Makefiles for compiling under 16- and 32- bit DOS.
	* 16-bit DOS can't keep all the codepages loaded at the same 
	 time, so in that version codepages are loaded as required.

2005-10-15 John Elliott

	* Redesigned the codepage tables to support multiple Unicode 
	 characters per glyph.
	* psfremap replaced by psfxform, which can do all kinds of 
	 extra things.
	* Added psfmerge (merge two Unicode PSFs) and psfjoin (concatenate
	 two non-Unicode PSFs)
	* psf2zx and zx2psf now support additional formats - raw, tap,
	 ROM and sna.
	* All (or nearly all) psf2* programs now take a --codepage option
	 allowing a given codepage to be extracted from a Unicode PSF.

2005-10-07 John Elliott

	* Fixed a bug in psf_unicode_delete() which caused it to enter an
	 infinite loop.
	* Added CPI library and CPI utilities (cpi2psf, psfs2cpi, cpicomp, 
	 cpidcomp)
	* Added psf_unicode_lookup() so single characters can be found by 
	 their Unicode ID.

2004-06-04 John Elliott

	* Added support for Hercules WriteOn (.wof) format.

2003-11-28 John Elliott

	* psftools-0.9.9 released.
