PSFTOOLS - Conversion tools for .PSF fonts
==========================================

  The PSFTOOLS are designed to manipulate fixed-width bitmap fonts, such as 
DOS or Linux console fonts. Both the PSF1 (8 pixels wide) and PSF2 (any width)
formats are supported; the default output format is PSF2.

  Note that these programs share no code with the Linux console utilities 
(kbd).

New in psftools 1.1.0
=====================

* Added support for codepages with more than 256 characters. This leads to
 a revision of the .CP2 file format to support these codepages.
* Codepage names are now matched case-insensitively.
* New codepages: LS3 (LocoScript 3), QX10 (Epson QX-10) and PRINTIT (MML 
 Systems Printit, a subset of QX10)
* raw2psf: Bugfix: --codepage was not setting the Unicode mapping on
           the last character in the font.
* ams2psf: Now supports SCRCHAR.JOY, the LocoScript screen font file
* psf2ams: If passed an 8x16 font, the self-loading COM file now loads it at 
           full height on the PCW16 (and scales it down on other computers).
* psf2xbm: Added an --across option allowing the width of the output bitmap 
           to be changed (height is adjusted to match).

Usage
=====

  Nearly all the programs currently supplied are file-format converters, which 
can be used as filters in a pipe. The generic command is:

	<program> { options } { inputfile { outputfile } } 

  If the input/output files are not present, standard input and output are
used. Options vary from program to program, but should be preceded with a 
double dash ("--"). A double dash by itself means "end of options".

  For details of the options provided by each utility, see the supplied manual
pages, or type <program> --help.

Unicode support
===============

  Support for the Unicode table in .PSFs was last improved in version 1.1.0. 

  Utilities that write .PSF files automatically attach a Unicode 
directory if they know the encoding used; if not, the --codepage option 
should be used to attach one. To get a list of codepages supported, run 
psfpages; see codepage.txt in this directory for more information.

  The utility psfxform can extract a subset of a PSF file. This can be used 
with the --codepage option to produce a 256-character PSF for older systems or
programs that don't understand the Unicode directory. It also has a 
--setcodepage option, which replaces the Unicode directory (if any) in the 
source file with the mappings in the specified codepage.

  Utilities that convert PSF files to other formats nearly all support the 
--codepage option in the same way as psfxform does; this should be used when 
converting a PSF with a Unicode directory to other formats. The exception 
is psf2zx, where the codepage to use is always the same and so is hardcoded 
in the program.
  
Windows fonts: psf2fnt, fnt2psf
-------------------------------

psf2fnt converts a .PSF to a Windows font. Note that the resulting Windows 
font is in the .FNT format used by FONTEDIT, not the hideously complicated 
.FON format used by Windows itself - see fnts2fon below.

fnt2psf is a much simpler program - it converts a .FNT to a .PSF. A warning
        is displayed if the font file is not monospaced, but conversion will
        still go ahead. 

DOS fonts: psf2raw, raw2psf, mda2psf, cpi2psf, psfs2cpi, cpicomp, cpidcomp
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  psf2raw converts a .PSF font into a raw bitmap font, as used by console font
editors under DOS and other platforms. 

  raw2psf reverses the process, adding a PSF header and possibly a Unicode
table to a raw bitmap font. raw2psf has a number of options enabling it 
to extract fonts from a file that may contain multiple fonts, or to handle 
files that only contain partial font data. Take, for example, the OS ROM
for the BBC Micro; this has bitmaps for characters 32-127 only, located at
the start of the file. The following command:

	raw2psf --first=32 --last=127 --height=8 --codepage=BBCMICRO os12.rom

will create a 128-character PSF file, with 32 blank slots followed by the 
characters.

  mda2psf converts a dump of a Monochrome Display Adapter character ROM to
a PSF with 9x14 characters.

  psfs2mda generates a character ROM suitable for use in an IBM CGA / MDA, or
a Compaq CGA.

  cpi2psf extracts a font from a DOS codepage (.CPI) file. File formats
supported are FONT (MSDOS/PCDOS), DRFONT (DRDOS), FONT.NT (Windows NT/2000)
and .CP (Linux).
 
  Note that you cannot load .CPI files from standard input; only load them 
from a disk file.

  psfs2cpi combines one or more PSF files into a CPI file. For example:

	psfs2cpi +437 eg8.psf eg16.psf +850 eg8.psf eg16.psf \
	         +860 eg8.psf eg16.psf +863 eh8.psf eh16.psf eg.cpi

  will generate a CPI file called eg.cpi, containing codepages 
  437, 850, 860 and 863 in two sizes. The first three codepages will have
  been based on eg8.psf and eg16.psf; the last on eh8.psf and eh16.psf.

  If the PSF files in question have Unicode directories, and the codepage
  is one of the ones known to psfs2cpi, then the appropriate glyphs will be
  extracted from the file; this is how three code pages can be based on a
  single PSF file. If the codepage number is not known, or the PSF file has
  no Unicode directory, then the first 256 characters of the PSF file
  will be used.

  [DOS ONLY: If you're using the DOS version of PSFTOOLS, you may need to 
  specify more filenames than will fit in the 128-character command line 
  buffer.  In this case, you can do something like:

        psfs2cpi --drfont @sources.txt eg.cpi
  
  where sources.txt contains the list of codepages and files:

  +437 foo16.psf foo14.psf foo08.psf foo06.psf 
  +850 foo16.psf foo14.psf foo08.psf foo06.psf 
  ...  ]

  cpicomp compresses a codepage by converting it into the DRFONT format.
  cpidcomp reverses cpicomp, expanding a DRFONT codepage to the FONT format.

  cpi.txt in this directory explains the CPI file format. There are various
  other descriptions around, but I found they didn't describe the format 
  quite accurately enough to write it, only to read it. 

Sinclair Spectrum fonts: psf2zx, zx2psf
---------------------------------------

psf2zx converts a .PSF font to a Spectrum font in +3DOS, TAP or raw format.
zx2psf converts a Spectrum +3 console font to .PSF format. A Spectrum +3 font
       only covers characters 32-127 so there are quite a lot of options for
       what to do with the remainder of the font.

Text files: psf2txt, txt2psf
----------------------------
psf2txt and txt2psf are my excuse for not supplying a proper font editor.

psf2txt dumps a PSF file as text, in a somewhat arbitrary format. txt2psf
transforms that text file back to PSF.

  The format of the text file is a header, formed:

%PSF2		
Version: n		// Version must always be 0
Flags: n		// 1 to create Unicode table, 0 not to
Length: n		// Number of characters to allocate
Width: n		// Width of a character cell
Height: n		// Height of a character cell

  and then a number of character blocks, each formed:

%
Bitmap:	-##---##- \	// Character bits, width*height of them.
	----#---- \	// Only dashes and hashes matter; whitespace
	etc.		// is ignored.

Unicode: 		// The Unicode codepoints that this character
			// represents. It's formed of one or more 
			// hexadecimal numbers in square brackets
			// followed by semicolons - eg:
			//
			// [0041];[00391]; 
			//
			// If a character represents one or more sequences of
			// codepoints, the sequence(s) follow the single
			// characters. They are represented similarly, 
			// with the individual codepoints separated by + 
			// signs within the square brackets:
			//
			// [00B4+0065]; 

Wyse-60 soft fonts
------------------
psf2wyse converts a .PSF font to a Wyse-60 compatible soft font. Note that
        for best results, the font should be 16 or 9 pixels high (depending
        on video mode) and 7 or 8 pixels wide.

wyse2psf converts a Wyse soft font to PSF.

BBC Micro soft fonts
--------------------
psf2bbc  converts a .PSF font to a BBC Micro soft font. For best results the
	font should be at most 8 pixels by 8.
	 nb: On an original BBC, only a limited range of characters can be
	redefined at any one time, unless you first 'explode' the font with a 
	sequence of *FX20 commands (*FX20,n where 1 <= n <= 6). On a Master 
	or a system with a second processor, everything Just Works.
 
	 To load the font under the native OS on a BBC, execute it: 
        *EXEC fontfile
	 To load it under CP/M or DOS Plus, display it:
	TYPE fontfile
	 To load it under Risc OS, set its filetype to FF7 and double-click it.

bbc2psf	 reverses the process, converting a BBC Micro soft font to PSF.

Amstrad CP/M fonts
------------------
psf2ams  either:
	* Converts a .PSF font to a .COM file which installs the associated 
	 font under CP/M on the CPC, PCW, PcW16 and Spectrum +3;
	* Converts a .PSF font to a SCRCHAR.JOY file for LocoScript 3.
	* Injects a .PSF font into a CP/M or LocoScript 1 .EMS file.
ams2psf  converts self-loading font .COM files back to .PSF, and attempts 
	to extract fonts that have been embedded in .EMS files or 
	the LocoScript character file SCRCHAR.JOY.

Converting PSFs to other things: psf2inc, psf2xbm, psf2bdf, psf2bsd
-------------------------------------------------------------------

psf2inc: Convert a .PSF font to C source, or Digital Research RASM86 source. 
psf2bsd: Convert a .PSF font to a NetBSD 'wsfont' kernel header.
psf2xbm: Convert a .PSF font to an X-Window bitmap, for display purposes. This
        can be useful when experimenting with other programs that output .PSFs;
        just pipe the result into " psf2xbm | xv - " to see the output.
psf2bdf: Convert a .PSF font to an X-Window bitmap font. The resulting font
	should be fine-tuned in an editor such as xmbdfed. 

Hercules WriteOn fonts: psf2wof, wof2psf
----------------------------------------

  psf2wof converts a .PSF font into a .wof font which should be suitable for
use in the Hercules WriteOn word processor.
  wof2psf converts a font in the Hercules WriteOn format into a PSF file.

  The WriteOn format isn't documented. It appears to consist of a 22-byte 
header followed by character data. The header is composed of little-endian 
words:

	defw	5343h	;Magic number
	defw	1	;File format version? Or another magic number?
	defw	16h	;Length of header
	defw	width	;Width of a character, pixels
	defw	height	;Height of a character, pixels
	defw	0Eh	;Seems to be the same in all WOF files
	defw	firstc	;First character in file
	defw	lastc	;Last character in file
	defw	0	;Same in all files?
	defw	width	;Width again?
	defw	0	;Same in all files?

General transformations: psfxform
----------------------------------

psfxform can transform a PSF file in various ways. It can:
* Add a Unicode directory if one is not present, or replace the existing 
 directory if one is;
* Remove a Unicode directory if one is present;
* Move character bitmaps from one position to another;
* Change the height or width of the character cell;
* [New in 1.0.2] double the height of some or all characters;
* [New in 1.0.3] scale some or all characters to match the new character size;
* Make some or all characters bold, thin, inverse or mirror-imaged;
* Extract a subset of the source file, either by codepage or by character
 range.

 A range is specified as a comma-separated list of character sequences. For
 example, to increase a DOS codepage 437 font from 8x16 to 10x20, the 
 following command:

 psfxform --width=10 --height=20 --centre --repeat=8,10,179-223 from.psf to.psf

 would apply --centre to all characters, but --repeat only to those line 
 graphics which needed it.

(psfremap from psftools-0.9.9 has been superseded by psfxform). 

Miscellaneous: fnts2fon, fon2fnts
=================================

fnts2fon and fon2fnts are not strictly PSF tools, since they don't operate on
.PSF files. What they attempt to do is handle Windows's insanely complicated
.FON file format - an executable containing one or more font resources.

fnts2fon
--------

  fnts2fon attempts to compile one or more .FNT fonts into a .FON file. 
This procedure is shrouded in darkness and mystery, dimly illuminated by the 
Microsoft Knowledge Base article 
<http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q76/5/35.ASP>
and the NE file format.

  The current fnts2fon has been tested with:

> Building the Windows 1.x .FON files from .FNT files. The script which does 
 this (win1fonts) has been included.
> Building a new Windows 1.x font from a .FNT file generated by psf2fon. 
 The resulting font could be used on Windows 1.0.
> Building a new Windows 2.x/3.x font from a .FNT file. The resulting font 
 worked in Windows 2.03 and 3.x.

  Note that fnts2fon has only been tested with raster .FON files, not 
vector ones. 

  fnts2fon has many options; these are mainly used by win1fonts to force 
the fonts it creates to be identical to Windows' own. They aren't necessary 
for building 'new' fonts.

  New in psftools 1.0.2: Under DOS, the --fontid option uses underlines
to replace spaces:

--fontid=FONTRES_n,n,n_:_font_name   

while the Unix version continues to use spaces:

--fontid="FONTRES n,n,n : font name"  

fon2fnts
--------

  fon2fnts extracts font resources from a Windows EXE, DLL or FON file, and
saves them as .FNT files.

  Syntax:

  fon2fnts fonfile fonfile ...

  Each file will be saved with a unique name. For example, using fon2fnts on 
ROMAN.FON will extract four files, called Roman_36.fnt, Roman_36_1.fnt, 
Roman_36_2.fnt and Roman_36_3.fnt.

loadpsf: Load a font
====================

  loadpsf is only present in DOS builds. It loads the specified font file 
into the computer's video card (assuming that the card supports this).

  Syntax:

  loadpsf filename.psf { options }

  Options are:
	--first:  If the font has more than 256 characters, only load
		characters 0-255. 
	--second: If the font has more than 256 characters, only load the
		characters 256-511.
	--alt:    Load this font as the alternative font. If it has more 
		than 256 characters, characters 256-511 will be loaded as
		the main font. 

  If neither --first or --second is present, loadpsf will treat the input 
file as a sequence of 256-character fonts, and load as many of them into the
video card as will fit. In the case of the Hercules cards, this can be up to
12.

  loadpsf supports the following hardware:
	* EGA / VGA
	* IBM PC Convertible
	* Compaq Portable III / Compaq Portable 386 
	* Hercules Graphics Card Plus / InColor
	* Apricot PC / Xi
	* Apricot F-Series
	* Wang Professional Computer

  The behaviour of loadpsf varies according to what display hardware it finds:

* On the EGA / VGA: Fonts must be 8 pixels wide or less. Fonts loaded with 
 "--alt" will be used to draw bright text.

* On the IBM Convertible: Fonts must be 8x8 pixels. Fonts loaded with "--alt"
 will be used to draw bold text.
	
* On the Compaq Portables: As for the Convertible, but fonts can be up to 
 8x16 pixels.

* On the Hercules: Fonts must be 8x14 pixels. Fonts with more than 256 
 characters (or fonts loaded with "--alt") will force the card into 48k 
 RAMfont mode. 

* On the Apricot PC / Xi: Fonts can be at most 10x16 pixels. Fonts loaded 
 with --alt will be ignored.

* On the Apricot F-Series: Fonts must be 8x10 or 8x8 pixels, and will be 
 loaded into the correct slot automatically. Fonts loaded with --alt will
 be ignored.

* On the Wang PC: If there is only one class of video card present (colour or
 mono) then the font will be loaded into that display and alternative fonts
 will be ignored. If both colour and mono cards are present, the font will 
 be loaded for the currently active display, and the --alt option selects the
 other display.
  If you have two or more displays of the same class (eg: two colour or two 
 mono) loadpsf will load the same font into both.
  The CGDC high-resolution display is not supported. Neither is the IBM 
 emulation card (class 0x16).
  If a mono card is present, maximum font size is 10x12. Otherwise it is 8x8.
