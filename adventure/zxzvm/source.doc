Notes on building ZXZVM
=======================

  The source files are divided into four groups:

vm*.zsm    - Machine-independent code to build ZXZVM.BIN
zx*.zsm,resi*.zsm - Machine-dependent code for the Spectrum, to build ZXIO.BIN
anne*.zsm  - Machine-dependent code for the PCW16, to build ANNEIO.PRG
joy*.zsm   - Machine-dependent code for the PCW10, to build JOYCEIO.COM
             (this gets packed as PCWZVM.COM).

             (For brevity, I use PCW10 to mean PCW8000 series, PCW9000 series
             and PCW10 series).

  The ZSM files are fairly standard Z80 assembly code, and most assemblers
should be able to handle them with no difficulty.

This version of ZXZVM was developed under Unix.

The following tools were used:

* Julian Albo's "pasmo" assembler (v0.5.2).
[Garry Lancaster: previously, Udo Monk's "z80asm" assembler was used, but
 this generated unspecified errors when trying to build with my modifications,
 even though the actual binary files appeared to have been correctly built.]

* "tapeconv" is a utility from the FUSE utils package. It is only required
  to convert the Spectrum .TAP files to .TZX format (which can be more
  convenient for outputting to cassette tape).

* A build utility ("xbm2zsm") is compiled using gcc; any ANSI C compiler
  should be able to compile them.

* "annelint" is a Bourne shell script designed to stop me from doing stupid
  things when writing PCW16 code. It is not necessary to use it to build
  the PCW16 file.

* "make run" runs the +3 version in an emulator; "make pcwrun" starts
  the PCW10 version in an emulator. "make pcw16run" copies the PCW16 version 
  to a directory where my PCW16 emulator can find it, and launches the 
  emulator. Some or all of these require additional build tools - plus,
  of course, the emulators themselves.
