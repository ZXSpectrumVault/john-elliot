\begin_layout Subsection
What ANNE does
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ANNE emulates a PcW16 computer - an 8-bit computer intended by Amstrad as
 a word processor, and manufactured around 1996.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What's new?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Since v2.2.0:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
JOYCE will now prompt you when a CP/M program attempts to access files outside
 the emulator (for example, the supplied IMPORT or EXPORT utilities).
 This warning can be controlled from f6=Settings | General | File Access...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Windows version is distributed with the latest SDL.DLL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Various compilation fixes on Unix platforms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Since v2.1.0:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A crash that occurs when trying to load the rescue disc has been corrected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Initial support for compiling under Mac OS X has been added.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is now possible to use a folder on the host computer as a CP/M disc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Native GSX support is now present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Can now boot CP/M.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Successfully detects when a disc image has been changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does not let the mouse pointer go off the bottom of the PcW16 screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Installation from a .CFI file (rather than a physical PcW16 rescue disc)
 now works correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With graphics acceleration turned on, the word processor display is not
 corrupted by scrolling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Floppy acceleration is a whole lot better than it was before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When you create a new disc image file, you will be asked whether it should
 be 720k or 1.4Mb.
 It will then be formatted, so you don't have to use the PcW16 file manager
 to format new discs.
 Instead, answer yes when it asks you if you want to create PcW16 folders
 on the disc.
\end_layout

\end_inset

Concepts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When moving from a PcW to an emulator, the biggest change you have to accustom
 yourself to is the way that ANNE handles discs.
 Real PcW16s use real floppy discs
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The PCW16 design allowed a hard drive interface to be added.
 ANNE does not emulate this.
\end_layout

\end_inset

; you use the recovery disc to reload the system after a crash, a data disc
 to save your work on, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible for ANNE to use real disc drives in the same way that a PcW
 does.
 However this is pretty slow and awkward; since the PC's got a hard drive,
 you might as well use it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Disc image files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each floppy disc is read into the PC's hard drive and stored as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

disc image file
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is a one-time process; once the disc image files are created, the
 discs themselves are no longer needed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Disc image files have a number of advantages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They are much faster than real floppy discs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You don't have to be shuffling a stack of floppies every time you want to
 use ANNE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you want more discs, you don't have to go to the shop to buy them.
 You just create more disc image files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By convention, these have names ending in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.dsk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So instead of having a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

manuscripts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 disc, you would have a disc image file called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

manuscripts.dsk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 To normal
\size small
 
\noun on
Unix 
\size default
\noun toggle
or Windows software, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

manuscripts.dsk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is just one file, but PcW programs see it as a disc with any number of
 PcW files on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One consequence of this is that the PcW16's floppy drive has nothing to
 do with your PC's real floppy drives.
 You can be working with a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

disc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the PcW's drive even when there's nothing in your real floppy drive(s).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Converting your PcW discs to disc image files is covered in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: setup"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Disc image folders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ANNE 2.1.8 and later can use folders instead of CP/M disc image files.
 In this system, one PcW disc corresponds to one PC folder.
 This has the advantage that each PcW file corresponds exactly to one PC
 file.
 For example, you could put text files in that folder, and then use the
 PcW's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Import
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 facility to import files from them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Floppy Acceleration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you have floppy acceleration turned on, ANNE doesn't use disc images
 any more.
 When programs refer to the 'disc drive', they are actually looking at a
 directory called PcW16FS on your hard drive.
 This is more convenient if you want to share files between the PcW16 environmen
t and the rest of the world, and you don't have to worry about disc images
 only holding 1.4Mb.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
ROMs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A real PcW16 has 1 megabyte of flash ROM, which holds the contents of the
 Cabinet, the built-in software, and the user settings.
 In the case of a program crash, the contents of the flash ROM could be
 lost, forcing a time-consuming reload from the recovery disc and data backups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ANNE doesn't just use one flash ROM - it allows you to choose from several.
 One (called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Previous session
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) is automatically saved when you leave ANNE; another (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Empty system
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) is created when the recovery disc is first read in.
 It is possible to save others at any time; for example, if you have a Cabinet
 full of documents, you can save a copy of the ROM, and revert to that later
 if something goes wrong.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The MENU key
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ANNE requires a Windows-style keyboard with a Menu key.
 On most keyboards, Menu is between AltGr and Ctrl, to the right of the
 space bar.
 Under Mac OS X, there is no Menu key (even if you've plugged in a PC keyboard,
 SDL doesn't recognise the key) and you should use Command-F9 (Windows+F9
 on a PC keyboard) instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Compiling ANNE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have downloaded ANNE as a binary for your platform (eg: the full
 Windows install, or an RPM), you can skip this section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To compile ANNE, you will need:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SDL, the Simple DirectMedia Layer: <http://www.libsdl.org>.
 You need version 1.0.8 or later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
libxml, the xml parser used by GNOME <http://www.libxml.org/>.
 ANNE was tested with version 2.2.6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
libpng, the image library.
 <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/>.
 You need version 1.0.6 or later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should be able to compile with the commands:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
./configure
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
make
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
sudo make install 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On systems with a GCC version earlier than 3.0, the first line should be
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

./configure --with-ministl
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To cross-compile ANNE for Windows, you need the XMINGW32 cross-compiler
 pack from <http://www.libsdl.org>, and MINGW32 versions of the above libraries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
ANNE on Mac OS X
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have successfully compiled ANNE on a Mac OS X (10.4.2) system.
 The process (and indeed MacOS X support in general) is pretty new and unpolishe
d.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, the three libraries mentioned above (SDL, libxml and libpng) had
 to be compiled from source and installed using their 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

make install
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 commands; pre-packaged OS X versions didn't seem to be suitable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, the configure script needed to be told what the host system was:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
./configure --host=powerpc-darwin-apple8.2.2
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
make
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
sudo make install
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thirdly, this builds an ANNE that is still very much a UNIX application;
 there's no application icon, no native OS X menu, and so on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Known bugs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This version of ANNE contains, or is thought to contain, the following bugs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Under MacOS X in full-screen mode, the mouse pointer can leave stray pixels
 where it has been.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The serial port support is untested.
 It is possible to use QTERM under CP/M, but the SIO device driver (SIO.FID)
 has not been tested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The emulated PcW hangs if, from the front screen, you click 'Help' then
 'Index'.

What if the speed is wrong? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
If ANNE is too slow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One solution is to increase the CPU speed.
 Press [MENU], then [f6] and select 'General'.
 Then enter the new speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may also be possible to improve the performance of ANNE by changing the
 video refresh frequency.
 This is normally 12, but it can be reduced to improve performance.
 If it is reduced to 3.75, for example, then programs may appear a little
 jerky, but ANNE should run at its full speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the video refresh frequency, start ANNE.
 At the opening screen, press [MENU], then [f6] and select 'Video'.
 Then enter the new frequency and press RETURN.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
If ANNE is too fast
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The built-in speed regulation in ANNE should stop it running too fast.
 Possibly you could reduce the overall speed: press [MENU], then [f6] and
 select 'General'.
 Then enter a new speed.

\end_inset

The Mouse
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PcW16 uses a Mouse Systems type mouse, connected to its second serial
 port (referred to by ANNE as COM3:).
 ANNE can emulate the mouse as either:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No emulated mouse.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Serial mouse on COM1 (the mouse is in the wrong socket)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Serial mouse on COM3 (the mouse is in the right socket)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Update ROSANNE directly (the ROSANNE mouse coordinates are updated directly,
 which produces much better results than the emulated serial mouse options)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To choose which emulation is selected, press [MENU] in ANNE; then [f6] for
 Settings, and choose Mouse.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to use ANNE with a real PcW16 (or compatible) mouse - any
 serial mouse that uses the MouseSystems protocol should be suitable.
 To do this, choose 'No emulated mouse', plug the mouse into a serial port,
 and set the PcW16's COM3 to use that port.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The disc drive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of a real disc drive, ANNE works with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

disc image files
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the computer's hard drive.
 These are fully described in sections 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: concepts"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: morediscs"

\end_inset

.
 If Rosanne acceleration is turned on (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: accel"

\end_inset

), then instead of disc image files, ANNE will use a directory on your hard
 drive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The LocoLink interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ANNE allows two forms of LocoLink communication (only one under Windows,
 though).
 In each case, you must have suitable software (LocoLink or PcWLink).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
LocoLink to a real computer (requires Linux)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ANNE will act as the master.
 Connect the parallel port of your Linux box to the other computer (if it's
 another PC, use a LapLink cable; if it's a PcW, use the original LocoLink
 cable).
 Go into the settings for the printer port, and set it to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Output to parallel port
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Then select the appropriate parallel port (normally /dev/parport0 or /dev/parpo
rt1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Go into the settings for the printer port and set it to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

output to Socket
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 On the screen that appears, select the correct socket type and name (see
 below) and ensure the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Client (Normal)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 option is ticked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Socket types and names
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
UNIX
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

domain
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

sockets (not supported on Windows) can be used to communicate with other
 emulators on the same computer.
 They work pretty much like normal files, and their names are normal filenames;
 so, for example, one might be called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/tmp/locolink.socket
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 When you are establishing a link, it is important that both ends are using
 the same socket name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
TCP/IP
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

sockets can be used to communicate with other emulators not only on the
 same computer, but across a network or the Internet.
 However, ANNE does not perform any security checks on socket connections,
 so I strongly recommend that you do not use TCP/IP sockets while connected
 to the Internet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
For a LocoLink master, the name of a TCP/IP socket is formed

\begin_layout Subsection
The Disks menu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Disks menu displays the status of the floppy drives, and allows you
 to eject or insert discs.
 Each drive has three lines in the menu:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The first line reads either 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Drive A: (Ejected)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Drive A: 
\emph on

\emph toggle

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This shows whether there is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (.DSK file) in the drive or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The second line reads either 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Eject
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Insert...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 depending whether there's a disc in the drive.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Eject
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 ejects the current disc (.DSK file); while 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Insert...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 brings up a window asking for the file to insert.
 You can also 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

insert
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a real floppy drive; this allows the emulated PcW to access a real drive
 directly (if slowly).
 If you change the disc in the real drive, you may need to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eject
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

insert
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the real drive, so that the PcW's own software can tell that the disc has
 changed.
 If you ask to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

insert
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a folder, and the folder you select has not previously been used in this
 way by JOYCE or ANNE, then you will be asked what format the folder should
 pretend to be in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The bottom line for each drive reads 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Read only
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 If there is a tick beside it then the write protect holes on the disc have
 been opened and it cannot be written to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you select
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 then a menu appears allowing you to read in extra floppy discs, or convert
 .DSK files back to real discs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Disc Management menu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are six options:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Add a boot ROM from a file - Reads in a boot ROM and adds it to the opening

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Delete a boot ROM - Removes a boot ROM from the opening menu.
 Use this option with caution!

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choose the item of hardware for which you want to make changes.
 Note that if you make a change such as disconnecting or connecting an interface
, the emulated PcW may not pick it up until the next reboot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\begin_layout Standard
Note: The menus in this section only allows you to create configurations

\family default
, you can create 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

impossible

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The settings in this menu are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Drive A: settings:

Extra drives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This menu allows you to set up drives C: - L: and N: - P:.
 Obviously these drives don't exist on real PcW16s, but they can on an ANNE
 system, though only under CP/M.
 You will need to have a copy of ANNEDRV.FID on your start-of-day disc for
 these drives to become available - see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: joycedrv"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each drive, you can set it up in three ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As direct access to the PC's floppy drives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As a floppy drive that accesses a standard disc image file, just like the
 emulated A: drive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As a hard drive with 8Mb of storage.
 The hard drive will also be stored on a .DSK file, but this .DSK file will
 not be usable in emulated floppy drives.

Rosanne Acceleration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\noun on
Rosanne Acceleration 
\noun default
allows certain functions normally performed by the PcW16's Rosanne operating
 system to be taken over by the emulator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To turn acceleration on, press the Menu key, then [F6] for the Settings
 menu, and select

Rosanne acceleration
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If there is no tick by 'Enabled', press SPACE.
 You will then see a list of further options, each of which can be ticked
 and unticked as required.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, acceleration replaces parts of Rosanne with calls to special
 functions in the emulator.
 This can greatly improve performance, though possibly at the cost of compatibil
ity for some programs.
 Rosanne acceleration has been tested on Rosanne v1.12; it may or may not
 work with other versions of Rosanne.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acceleration must be turned off during a reload from the rescue disc.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Floppy disc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this option is ticked, then instead of using a disc image file for its
 floppy drive, ANNE will use a directory on the hard drive ( 
\family typewriter
~/Joyce/PcW16FS)
\family default
.
 This has a number of advantages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It's faster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You can get files in and out of the PcW16 environment much more easily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The resulting drive is not limited to 1.4Mb.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The directory does not have to exist; to create it, turn on floppy disc
 acceleration, go into the File Manager, and press Control-L.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that when floppy disc acceleration is turned on, asking ANNE to insert
 or remove disc images will have no effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Graphics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this option is ticked, several low-level graphics operations will be
 implemented in native code.
 This considerably improves the speed of drawing of menus, dialogs, and
 those huge buttons on the front screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
ANNE Utilites

\begin_layout Standard
ANNEDRV.FID is a file which is used to add one or more extra disc drives
 to CP/M running within ANNE.
 The first of these drives will usually be drive C:.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unless the settings are changed (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\family typewriter
~/Joyce/Disks/c.dsk
\family default

, etc.
 This can be used to share files between an install of JOYCE and an install
 of ANNE.
 The drives cannot be accessed from Rosanne.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
DDJOYCE.PRL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DDJOYCE is new in v2.1.7.
 It is a GSX driver for the host PC's graphics screen, allowing high-resolution
 colour graphics to be used from CP/M.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use it, edit your ASSIGN.SYS file.
 Remove the entry which reads

 messages.
 The program then appears to hang until you press RETURN to acknowledge
 the message.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When DR Graph shuts down, the screen goes blank.
 This is because DR Graph does not make a proper 'close workstation' call
 when it terminates.
 Use the Action menu to switch back to the PcW16 screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
DR Draw works correctly, though text rendering is rather ugly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
DOSDIR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DOSDIR displays the contents of a directory in the host filesystem (the
 name DOSDIR is for compatibility with MYZ80).
 Syntax is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     DOSDIR
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  or DOSDIR {x:/path/}filespec
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if you include a path you must include a filename.
 The command
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     DOSDIR C:/IMAGES/       is invalid, but
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     DOSDIR C:/IMAGES/*.*    is valid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get lower-case commands, use:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     A>DOSDIR 
\backslash

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     DOSDIR>/usr/local/bin/* 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
EMULIOS.RSX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EMULIOS allows Digital Research Logo to use the 800x600 screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To set it up, use the following commands (under CP/M):
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
PIP EMULOGO.COM=LOGO.COM
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
GENCOM EMULOGO
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
GENCOM EMULOGO EMULIOS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- Then EMULOGO.COM will behave as LOGO.COM, but using the 800x600 screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following commands will behave differently:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
setpc Allows a number from 0 to 255
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
setbg Allows a number from 0 to 255
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
savepic The .PIC file saved is in Windows BMP format, and can be exported,
 renamed to .BMP, and loaded by paint programs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
loadpic The .PIC file loaded must be in Windows BMP format and have 256 colours,
 but its size does not have to be 800x600.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
EXPORT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EXPORT will write CP/M files out as UNIX files.
 It respects exact file sizes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The syntax is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     EXPORT cpmfile                    { [O] }
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     EXPORT unixfile=du:cpmfile        { [O] }
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first form of the command produce a UNIX file with the same name as
 the CP/M file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second form creates a UNIX file with a name that may be different from
 the CP/M name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're using UNIX rather than Windows, beware: because the CP/M CCP renders
 all filenames into uppercase, it's very unlikely you'll be able to pass
 directory names to EXPORT; if you say
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     EXPORT /home/fred/cpmfile
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EXPORT.COM will see "
\family typewriter
/HOME/FRED/CPMFILE
\family default
", which probably won't exist.
 To get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
round this, use:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     A>EXPORT 
\backslash

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     EXPORT>/home/fred/cpmfile
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
IMPORT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IMPORT will read UNIX files into the CP/M filesystem.
 It sets exact file sizes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The syntax is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     IMPORT {/path/}hostfile            { [O] }
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     IMPORT du:=/path/hostfile          { [O] }
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     IMPORT du:cpmfile=x:/path/hostfile { [O] }
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first form imports the named file (or files) to the current drive and
 user area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second form imports the file (or files) to the specified drive and user
 area, keeping the original name(s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third form imports the files, changing their name(s) to match the provided
 CP/M filename(s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the [O] option is present, existing CP/M files with the same name as
 an imported file will be overwritten without asking.
 Otherwise you are asked for confirmation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both filenames may include wildcards, and the second and third forms can
 include CP/M driveletters and user numbers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     A:IMPORT 
\backslash

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     IMPORT>2F:*.ASC=/usr/doc/*.txt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will import all the .txt files in /usr/doc to drive F, group 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Filenames are expanded case-sensitively, so you will normally need to use
 the backslash, as above, to get lower-case letters into the command line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
QUIT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Syntax: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
QUIT { 
\emph on
number
\emph default
 
\emph toggle
} { [O] }
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
QUIT will exit ANNE.
 With no parameters, it will check whether there are files on drive M: which
 may need saving, and if there are it will ask for confirmation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number parameter is the error level which ANNE should return.
 If there is no number parameter, ANNE returns 98.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The [O] option disables the M: drive check and quits immediately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
REDIR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
REDIR allows you to use one or more PC directories as drives under CP/M.
 See the separate file REDIR.DOC for more information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
VGA and VGACOM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
VGA.FID allows CP/M programs to make direct use of the PC screen and keyboard.
 This gives more text on the screen and faster output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once VGA.FID has loaded, type VGACOM ON to activate it, and VGACOM OFF to
 deactivate it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your PcW screen will now be 100 columns x 36 lines.
 Nearly all the normal PcW escape codes are supported, which should enable
 character-based programs to be run.
 Since screen output is now being done by the host PC's processor, you should
 notice an improvement in speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following escape codes work differently in the 800x600 VGA mode:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
ESC
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

b
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

ESC
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

c set colours (so the numbers in the PALETTE command actually have meaning).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
ESC
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

y sets 32x90 mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
ESC
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

z sets 36x100 mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
ANNE utilities (PC hosted)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't want to use ANNE's own methods for converting between disc
 files and image files, you can also use the 
\noun on
dsktrans
\noun toggle
 program, which is installed with ANNE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command to use is either:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsktrans /dev/fd
\emph on
n
\emph default
 
\emph toggle
dskfile 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
 
\emph toggle
  
\emph default
 
\family roman
\emph toggle
- Floppy disc to image file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsktrans dskfile /dev/fd
\emph on
n
\emph default
 
\emph toggle
-otype floppy 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
 
\emph toggle
  
\emph default
 
\family roman
\emph toggle
- Image to floppy disc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DSKTRANS isn't as versatile as CPCTRANS (for example, it can only handle
 discs in recognisable PcW or +3DOS formats) but it doesn't need telling
 what sort of disc it is using, and it is a native (not DOS-hosted) program.
