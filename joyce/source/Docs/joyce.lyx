\end_inset

Concepts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When moving from a PCW to an emulator, the biggest change you have to accustom
 yourself to is the way that JOYCE handles discs.
 Real PCWs (except the few with add-on hard drives) use real floppy discs;
 you use a start-of-day disc to use LocoScript or MicroDesign, a data disc
 to save your work on, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible for JOYCE to use real disc drives in the same way that a
 PCW does.
 However this is pretty slow and awkward; since the PC's got a hard drive,
 you might as well use it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Disc image files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PCW programs can't generally use the PC's hard drive directly.
 For one thing, it's too big; and for another, it's not in CP/M format
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If you do happen to have a CP/M partition on your hard drive, I don't want
 to know.
 JOYCE still won't use it.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Instead, JOYCE creates one or more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

disc image files
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Each of these is the equivalent of one real PCW disc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Disc image files have a number of advantages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They are much faster than real floppy discs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You don't have to be shuffling a stack of floppies every time you want to
 use JOYCE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you want more discs, you don't have to go to the shop to buy them.
 You just create more disc image files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By convention, these have names ending in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.dsk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So instead of having a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

manuscripts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 disc, you would have a disc image file called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

manuscripts.dsk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 To normal
\size small
 
\noun on
Unix 
\size default
\noun toggle
or Windows software, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

manuscripts.dsk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is just one file, but PCW programs see it as a disc with any number of
 PCW files on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One consequence of this is that the PCW's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

B
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 drives have nothing to do with your PC's real floppy drives.
 The emulated PCW can be happily using a disc in its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

B
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 drive even if your PC has only one drive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Converting your PCW discs to disc image files is covered in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: setup"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Disc image folders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
JOYCE 2.1.8 and later can also use folders instead of disc image files.
 In this system, one PCW disc corresponds to one PC folder.
 This has the advantage that each PCW file corresponds exactly to one PC
 file.
 For example, you could instruct the PCW to make ASCII files, save them
 to such a disc/folder, and then read them directly with PC software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Compiling JOYCE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have downloaded JOYCE as a binary for your platform (eg: the full
 Windows install, or an RPM), you can skip this section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To compile JOYCE, you will need:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SDL, the Simple DirectMedia Layer: <http://www.libsdl.org>.
 You need version 1.0.8 or later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
libxml, the xml parser used by GNOME <http://www.libxml.org/>.
 JOYCE was tested with version 2.2.6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
libpng, the image library.
 <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/>.
 You need version 1.0.6 or later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should be able to compile with the following commands: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
./configure
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
make
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
sudo make install 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On systems with a GCC version earlier than 3.0, the first line should be
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

./configure --with-ministl
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To cross-compile JOYCE for Windows, you need the XMINGW32 cross-compiler
 pack from <http://www.libsdl.org>, and MINGW32 versions of the above libraries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
JOYCE on Mac OS X
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have successfully compiled JOYCE on a Mac OS X (10.4.2) system.
 The process (and indeed MacOS X support in general) is pretty new and unpolishe
d.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, the three libraries mentioned above (SDL, libxml and libpng) had
 to be compiled from source and installed using their 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

make install
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 commands; pre-packaged OS X versions didn't seem to be suitable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, the configure script needed to be told what the host system was:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
./configure --host=powerpc-darwin-apple8.2.2
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
make
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
sudo make install
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thirdly, this builds a JOYCE that is still very much a UNIX application;
 there's no application icon, no native OS X menu, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, OS X uses the [f9] and [f10] keys for Exposé; so you will need
 to use [Command]+[F9] and [Command]+[F10] instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Missing Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These features were present in JOYCE 1.36 but not in the current JOYCE:

Adding boot discs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first time JOYCE is started, it will detect that no boot discs have
 been read in.
 Unless you want to boot laboriously from a floppy every time you use JOYCE,
 you should choose the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

set up boot discs properly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you had a previously working JOYCE installation, then this will be detected,
 and you will be given the option to copy boot discs from it.
 If you decide not to to this, you will have to provide start-of-day discs
 or disc image files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next menu that appears asks you for the location of the boot disc to
 use.
 If you are using real floppies, then select the correct drive (A: or B:).
 If you are using pre-prepared DSK files, choose the correct file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are copying a MicroDesign program disc with copy protection (or other
 similar programs such as Tweak3), you will also need to click on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Advanced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at this point and select the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

MicroDesign program disc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 option.
 Note that this will not work on stock Windows NT, 2000 or XP; see section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: md3nt"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next select 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Continue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 You will be asked for a name to give to this boot disc (eg: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

LocoScript
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CP/M
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have entered the name, the disc is read in and converted to a JOYCE
 .DSK file.
 If you were copying from a real disc, you can put it away when the drive
 light goes out; JOYCE won't need it again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can then repeat for as many boot discs as you like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have trouble copying boot discs under Windows 95, 98 or ME, then
 see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "failread"

\end_inset

 which describes a workaround using PCWTRANS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
After copying boot discs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The JOYCE opening screen will appear, with up to 9 boot discs listed on
 it.
 If you read in more than 9, press [f3] to see the others.
 Choose the disc you want to use, and the black stripes should start to
 march down the screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you are ready to quit, press [f10].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reading in other discs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The JOYCE automatic setup routine only covers start-of-day discs.
 To convert other discs (eg, data discs), press [f9] for the JOYCE menu,
 then [f2] for the Discs menu, and select 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Disc Management
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 From the menu that appears, choose 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Convert floppy to JOYCE DSK file
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The rest of the procedure is similar to the one for boot discs, described
 in section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What if I haven't got 3.5
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 start-of-day discs? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have the ability to transfer files to and from your PCW (by a serial
 link or LocoLink, for example) and 1Mb of memory (512k for 8000 series
 PCWs) then you can use DU54 to make the disc images.
 Download DU54 from my website, and use its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Copy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 option to copy from a disc to a file in CPCEMU format.
 Then transfer the resulting file to your PC.
 These files will be bigger than the floppies they were copied from; so
 you need a big RAMdrive to put them in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have the files on the PC in CPCEMU format, proceed as described
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: addboot"

\end_inset

, with pre-prepared disc images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What if I haven't got start-of-day discs at all?
\end_layout

The basic concept of disc image files was described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: concepts"

\end_inset

.
 There are several subtleties to be aware of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Boot discs (also known as start-of-day discs)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When JOYCE is started, both disc drives are normally empty.
 As soon as you select which system to boot, the disc image you chose (normally
 named something like 
\family typewriter
~/Joyce/Boot/boot1.dsk
\family default
) will be inserted in the PCW's A drive.
 You can add, remove or rename boot discs using the Disc Management menu
 (press [f9] for the JOYCE menu, then [f2] (Disc) and choose 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Disc Management
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Ejecting a disc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To eject a disc, press [f9] for the JOYCE menu, then [f2] (Disc).
 If there is a disc in the PCW's A or B drive, you can eject it by selecting
 the corresponding 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eject
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 option.
 Remember that ejecting discs from JOYCE's emulated drives doesn't have
 anything to do with whatever floppy drives are actually fitted to the PC.

Command-line options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start JOYCE and make it automatically boot from one of the discs on the
 boot menu, use:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
xjoyce -A #
\emph on
n
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
for example
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
xjoyce -A #2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will choose option 2 from the boot menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want JOYCE automatically to run a boot disc file (not necessarily
 one of the ones on the menu), then use -A with a filename:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
xjoyce -A locoscript3.dsk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will load "locoscript3.dsk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to start with a floppy disc in drive B:, then use the -B command-lin
e option: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
xjoyce -B /home/fred/Joyce/Disks/diskb.dsk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
JOYCE can also start an EMS/EMT file directly.
 To do this, use -E:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
xjoyce -E /tmp/j14cpm3.ems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can add a memory-size option to any of the above commands - for example,
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
xjoyce -A locoscript140.dsk -m 256
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will boot from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

locoscript140.dsk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with 256k memory (LocoScript 1.40 malfunctions with the default 2Mb).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Non-floppy discs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
JOYCEDRV.FID gives the emulated PCW a hard drive, and/or direct access to
 PCW floppy discs.
 It requires a recent version of CP/M (BIOS 1.8 or later) or LocoScript 2.30
 or later.
 It uses a similar "disc image file" system to the floppy drives, but the
 image files can be up to 8Mb in size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
REDIR.COM allows you to use one or more 
\noun on
Unix 
\noun toggle
directories as CP/M drives.
 It will run under any version of CP/M.
 This avoids the problem that the host PC can't see "inside" image files
 without extra software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
IMPORT.COM and EXPORT.COM will copy single files into or out of the JOYCE
 environment.
 They will run under any version of CP/M.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these utilities are on the file UTILS.DSK.
 You can get at them with a command something like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
xjoyce -B=/usr/local/lib/Joyce/Disks/utils.dsk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and they will appear on drive B:.
 REDIR.COM and its companion programs are in Group 1; the others are in Group
 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What if the speed is wrong? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
If JOYCE is too slow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One solution is to increase the CPU speed.
 Press [f9], then [f6] and select 'General'.
 Then enter the new speed; since my original PCW had a Sprinter, I prefer
 to run at 200% speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may also be possible to improve the performance of JOYCE by changing
 the video refresh frequency.
 This is normally 12, but it can be reduced to improve performance.
 If it is reduced to 3.75, for example, then programs that use a mouse pointer
 may appear a little jerky, but JOYCE should run at its full speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the video refresh frequency, start JOYCE.
 At the opening screen, press [f9], then [f6] and select 'Video'.
 Then enter the new frequency and press RETURN.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
If JOYCE is too fast
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The built-in speed regulation in JOYCE should stop it running too fast.
 Possibly you could reduce the overall speed: press [f9], then [f6] and
 select 'General'.
 Then enter a new speed.
\end_layout

The keyboard

\begin_layout Standard
The PC keyboard is laid out a bit differently from the PCW keyboard.
 The following keys have non-obvious meanings:

 Other X servers may behave differently].

The PC ALT key is used as the PCW ALT key.
 In this mode the key captions match better than the key positions.

\begin_layout Standard
There were three major types of PCW mouse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
AMX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Kempston
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
KeyMouse
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
JOYCE emulates the first two of these; alternatively, it can emulate the

The AMX mouse emulation is tuned for MicroDesign 3, with the mouse movement
 option set to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Slow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Most programs support the AMX mouse, so this is probably the best choice.
 However, you will need a three-button mouse (or one with a scroll wheel)
 to use it successfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Kempston mouse
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Kempston mouse emulation is designed for Stop Press.
 Fewer programs support the Kempston mouse than the AMX, but it doesn't
 need a three-button mouse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Electric Studio lightpen
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lightpen emulation is designed for the programs supplied with the lightpen:
 NEWSDESK, ART and DDESP.PRL.
 Since the original light pen had no switches, the mouse buttons do not
 do anything; you will need to use keys on the keyboard as directed.

\begin_layout Standard
The Mouse Auto-Patch feature (only available with the AMX mouse emulation)
 is used to improve mouse handling in PCW programs.
 When it is switched on, JOYCE will attempt to link Microdesign, Stop Press
 or Masterpaint directly to the PC's mouse, bypassing the normal mouse driver.
 If successful, this results in smoother mouse performance.
\end_layout

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

sockets (not supported on Windows) can be used to communicate with other
 emulators on the same computer.
 They work pretty much like normal files, and their names are normal filenames;
 so, for example, one might be called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/tmp/locolink.socket
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 When you are establishing a link, it is important that both ends are using
 the same socket name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
TCP/IP
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

sockets can be used to communicate with other emulators not only on the
 same computer, but across a network or the Internet.
 However, JOYCE does not perform any security checks on socket connections,
 so I strongly recommend that you do not use TCP/IP sockets while connected
 to the Internet.

\begin_layout Standard
For a LocoLink slave, the name of the socket is formed

\end_inset

 brings up a window asking for the file to insert.
 You can also 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

insert
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choose the item of hardware for which you want to make changes.
 Note that if you make a change such as disconnecting or connecting an interface

\begin_layout Standard
This screen allows you to choose which PCW model to emulate, and how fast
 it should appear to be.
 Some points to note are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
JOYCE knows the difference between boot discs for dot-matrix PCWs (8256,
 8512, 9256, 10) and daisywheel PCWs (9512, 9512+).
 If you have selected a PCW model that doesn't match the boot disc, JOYCE
 selects the closest equivalent when booting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
JOYCE treats the PCW8256 and PCW8512 as one choice, since the only difference
 is the number of disc drives and the memory size, both of which can be
 configured in other menus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
JOYCE also treats the PCW9256 and the PCW10 as one choice.
 The differences between these models are the memory size and the presence
 of a Centronics port, both of which are configurable in other menus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This screen also allows you to control the warning that appears when a CP/M
 program attempts to access files outside the emulator (as, for example,

\begin_layout Standard
This menu allows you to set up drives C: - L: and N: - P:.
 Obviously these drives don't exist on real PCWs, but they can on a JOYCE
 system, provided you are using a recent version of CP/M (1.12 / 2.12 or later)

 You will need to have a copy of JOYCEDRV.FID on your start-of-day disc for
 these drives to become available - see section

\begin_layout Standard
For each drive, you can set it up in three ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As direct access to the PC's floppy drives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As a floppy drive that accesses a standard disc image file, just like the

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Joystick
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This allows a real joystick on the computer to simulate an add-on joystick
 for the PCW.
 The first part of the menu is used to select what PCW interface is being
 emulated - Kempston, Spectravideo or Cascade.
 Note that the Spectravideo and Cascade interfaces conflict with the CPS8256
 serial interface; don't try to use both at the same time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have set the joystick type, select the second option to choose
 which joystick on the host system should be connected to the emulated interface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Keyboard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The keyboard settings screen has five options.
 The first two are related to swapping keys: One controls which way round
 the CTRL and ALT keys are mapped (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: keyswap"

\end_inset

) and the other controls which way round the DELETE keys are (see section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: keyswap2"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next three keyboard options relate to the option links.
 PCW keyboards have three option links, and by default none of these links
 are connected.
 To my knowledge no PCW software uses the links, but for completeness JOYCE
 allows you to connect them here.
 The only one with a noticeable effect is LK2; if it's connected, pressing
 the Shift key will not cancel Shift Lock.
 For details of what LK1 and LK3 do, see the PCW hardware guide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also two joystick options.
 These relate to a curious little piece of history.
 The controllers in all PCW keyboards include joystick support; but there's
 no joystick socket for them to plug in to (compare the PC1512 keyboard,
 where there is a joystick socket).
 Strictly in the interests of completeness, JOYCE provides the joystick
 sockets.
 To activate one or the other, select 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Joystick 2
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 To the best of my knowledge no PCW software supports the keyboard joystick;
 use one of the other joystick models to to get something useful done.

 - the number of times per second that the screen is redrawn.
 You can go up to 50Hz (ie, the screen is redrawn 50 times a second) or
 down to 0.01Hz (the screen is drawn once every 10 seconds).
 The default setting in JOYCE is 12Hz, which is fine for nearly all programs;
 even at 3.75Hz CP/M and LocoScript work fine.

\begin_layout Standard
CENPORT is a fast driver for the standalone Centronics printer port.
 Just type:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
CENPORT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and printer output will be sent to the destination defined for that port.
 Any DEVICE setting for the printer will be ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CENPORT only works under CP/M.
 LocoScript 1 cannot print from JOYCE (except using the emulated dot-matrix
 printer).
 If LocoScript 2 and later do not detect the Centronics port, use the CPS8256
 printer port instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
DDJOYCE.PRL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DDJOYCE is a GSX driver for the host PC's graphics screen, allowing high-resolut
ion colour graphics to be used from CP/M.
 It requires JOYCE 2.1.7 or later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use it, edit your ASSIGN.SYS file.
 Remove the entry which reads

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and replace it by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DDJOYCE has been tested with the Digital Research programs DR Draw and DR
 Graph, with the following issues:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
DR Graph works correctly, but when it shuts down the screen goes blank.
 This is because DR Graph does not make a proper 'close workstation' call
 when it closes.
 Use the Action menu (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:The-Action-Menu"

\end_inset

) to switch back to the PCW screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
DR Draw works correctly, though text rendering is rather ugly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
DOSDIR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DOSDIR displays the contents of a directory in the host filesystem (the
 name DOSDIR is for compatibility with MYZ80).
 Syntax is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     DOSDIR
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  or DOSDIR {x:/path/}filespec
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if you include a path you must include a filename.
 The command
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     DOSDIR C:/IMAGES/       is invalid, but
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     DOSDIR C:/IMAGES/*.*    is valid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get lower-case commands, use:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     A>DOSDIR 
\backslash

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     DOSDIR>/usr/local/bin/*

\begin_layout Subsection
EMULIOS.RSX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EMULIOS allows Digital Research Logo to use the 800x600 screen.
 This was buggy in JOYCE 2.0.0-2.1.6, but has now been corrected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To set it up, use the following commands (under CP/M):
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
PIP EMULOGO.COM=LOGO.COM
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
GENCOM EMULOGO
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
GENCOM EMULOGO EMULIOS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- Then EMULOGO.COM will behave as LOGO.COM, but using the 800x600 screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following commands will behave differently:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
setpc Allows a number from 0 to 255
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
setbg Allows a number from 0 to 255
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
savepic The .PIC file saved is in Windows BMP format, and can be exported,
 renamed to .BMP, and loaded by paint programs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
loadpic The .PIC file loaded must be in Windows BMP format and have 256 colours,
 but its size does not have to be 800x600.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
EXPORT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EXPORT will write CP/M files out as UNIX files.
 It respects exact file sizes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The syntax is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     EXPORT cpmfile                    { [O] }
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     EXPORT unixfile=du:cpmfile        { [O] }
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first form of the command produce a UNIX file with the same name as
 the CP/M file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second form creates a UNIX file with a name that may be different from
 the CP/M name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beware: because the CP/M CCP renders all filenames into uppercase, it's
 very unlikely you'll be able to pass directory names to EXPORT; if you
 say
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     EXPORT /home/fred/cpmfile
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EXPORT.COM will see "
\family typewriter
/HOME/FRED/CPMFILE
\family default
", which probably won't exist.
 To get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
round this, use:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     EXPORT>/home/fred/cpmfile
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
IMPORT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IMPORT will read UNIX files into the CP/M filesystem.
 It sets exact file sizes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The syntax is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     IMPORT {/path/}hostfile            { [O] }
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     IMPORT du:=/path/hostfile          { [O] }
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     IMPORT du:cpmfile=x:/path/hostfile { [O] }
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first form imports the named file (or files) to the current drive and
 user area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second form imports the file (or files) to the specified drive and user
 area, keeping the original name(s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third form imports the files, changing their name(s) to match the provided
 CP/M filename(s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the [O] option is present, existing CP/M files with the same name as
 an imported file will be overwritten without asking.
 Otherwise you are asked for confirmation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both filenames may include wildcards, and the second and third forms can
 include CP/M driveletters and user numbers:

JOYCEDRV
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
JOYCEDRV.FID is a file which is used to add one or more extra disc drives
 to CP/M (v1.12/2.12+) or LocoScript (v2.30+) running within JOYCE.
 The first of these drives will usually be drive C:.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unless the settings are changed (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: extradrv"

\end_inset

) the drives will be set up as 8Mb hard drives, called 
\family typewriter
~/Joyce/Disks/c.dsk
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
~/Joyce/Disks/d.dsk
\family default
, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How many drives you get depends on your environment, but on my system I
 get five under CP/M (C:,D:,E:,F:,and G:), and thirteen under LocoScript
 (C: to L: and N: to P:).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To enable JOYCEDRV, copy the file JOYCEDRV.FID to your start-of-day disc
 image.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Start JOYCE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Select CP/M from the boot menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 Then press ESC to leave the menu system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Back at the CP/M prompt, type

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Press [f9], then [f5] to reboot, and confirm this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Select CP/M from the boot menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
JOYCEDRV should now list available drives.
 If not, then your version of CP/M is too old.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you try to use a disc image that JOYCEDRV cannot understand, you will
 not be able to access it.
 Under CP/M, you will get an "invalid drive" error; under LocoScript, you
 will get a "FID error".

\begin_layout LyX-Code
PCKEY keyfile
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
PCKEY keyfile fidfile
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PCKEY is used to alter the mapping of PC keys to PCW keys.
 You may need to use this utility if your keyboard does not have a UK layout,
 or you are using a laptop where some keys are difficult to get at.
 This was buggy in JOYCE 2.0.0-2.1.9, but has now been corrected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When PCKEY is given one parameter, it will read the keyfile and make the
 changes immediately.
 When it is given two, it will compile the keyfile into a .FID file, which
 can then be put on a start-of-day disc and which will make the necessary
 assignments every time JOYCE is started.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The format of the keyfile is a series of lines; each line reads:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
pc-number  modifier  pcw-number  {comment}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
pc-number is the number of the key.
 For a full listing, see Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "keycodes"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
NOTE:
\emph default
 
\emph toggle
These numbers changed between SDL 0.8 and SDL 0.10; so if you are upgrading
 JOYCE from a version which used SDL 0.8, you need to rewrite your PCKEY
 files.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
modifier must be N, for compatibility with the old DOS version of JOYCE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
pcw-number is the PCW key number.
 These are listed in the PCW manual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, a typical line might read:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
27 N 8  ESC goes to EXIT
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

Notes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The key mapping you have set remains until you exit JOYCE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The option in the Settings menu to swap CTRL/ALT and Backspace/Delete uses
 the same method as PCKEY.
 It is probably best not to map these four keys.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Key 256 brings up the JOYCE menu.
 Key 257 brings up the Exit Confirmation screen.

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
QUIT {

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
QUIT will exit JOYCE.
 With no parameters, it will check whether there are files on drive M: which
 may need saving, and if there are it will ask for confirmation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number parameter is the error level which JOYCE should return.
 If there is no number parameter, JOYCE returns 98.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The [O] option disables the M: drive check and quits immediately.

\begin_layout LyX-Code
RTC [C]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RTC reads the PC's built-in clock.
 It can be used in two ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
RTC by itself will set the PCW's clock from the PC's clock.
 The timing of the PCW's clock will then depend on the speed of emulation,
 which is another way of saying that it will gradually diverge from the
 PC's clock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
RTC
\begin_inset space ~

[C] links the PCW's clock to the PC's clock; it will be set to the correct
 time whenever CP/M reads it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
VGA and VGACOM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
VGA.FID allows CP/M programs to make direct use of the PC screen and keyboard.
 This gives more text on the screen and faster output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once VGA.FID has loaded, type VGACOM ON to activate it, and VGACOM OFF to
 deactivate it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your PCW screen will now be 100 columns x 36 lines.
 Nearly all the normal PCW escape codes are supported, which should enable
 character-based programs to be run.
 Since screen output is now being done by the host PC's processor, you should
 notice an improvement in speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you run DISCKIT or a graphical program like Stop Press, you will find
 that no output is visible; use the Action menu (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:The-Action-Menu"

\end_inset

) to switch back to the native PCW screen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
XPALETTE 
\emph on
br bg bb fr fg fb
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
XPALETTE takes advantage of the colours on a VGA screen to allow the PCW
 to display in any colour scheme, not just black and white.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The version with two parameters works the same way as on a CPC or a Spectrum
 +3 (though neither of these has as many colours as JOYCE has).
 For example, on a CPC you might type:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
PALETTE 2 63
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
to get white text on a blue background.
 So, in JOYCE, type
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
XPALETTE 2 63
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and the screen colours obediently change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The version with six parameters allows any colour in the 24-bit range to
 be selected, rather than just 64.
 Instead of a colour being represented by one number, it is represented
 by three:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
XPALETTE 0 0 32 255 255 251
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will give you a very dark blue background and a foreground with the slightest
 tinge of yellow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
XPALETTE does not mind how the numbers are separated (with commas, spaces,
 *s or whatever) and accepts Hex numbers preceded with & (128 = &80 etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note! Unlike 
\family typewriter
PALETTE 0 0
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
XPALETTE 0 0
\family default
 really does select black on black.
 This is not recommended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
JOYCE utilities (PC hosted)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't want to use JOYCE's own methods for converting between disc
 files and image files, you can also use the 
\noun on
dsktrans
\noun toggle
 program, which is installed with JOYCE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command to use is either:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsktrans /dev/fd
\emph on
n
\emph default
 
\emph toggle
dskfile 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\emph toggle
-otype floppy 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
 
\emph toggle
  
\emph default
 
\family roman
\emph toggle
- Image to floppy disc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DSKTRANS isn't as versatile as CPCTRANS (for example, it can only handle
 discs in recognisable PCW or +3DOS formats) but it doesn't need telling
 what sort of disc it is using, and it is a native (not DOS-hosted) program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To copy a MicroDesign 3 protected disc with DSKTRANS, add 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

MD3 discs and Windows NT / 2000 / XP

\begin_layout Standard
Windows NT, 2000 and XP will flat-out refuse to read MicroDesign 3 program
 discs, owing to the copy protection used on them.
 If you are using Windows 2000 or XP, then it is possible to install Simon

 In this case, select the

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are using Windows NT, or if you don't have the correct driver installed,
 there is no way to make JOYCE capable of reading MD3 discs.
 You will need to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Create a bootable DOS floppy disc.
 If you're on a system which can't do this, then you may be able to get
 hold of one at www.bootdisk.com.
 If you only have one floppy drive, the boot disc needs to include a RAM
 drive at least 1Mb in size.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Copy MD3TRANS.EXE to the DOS disc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Boot from the DOS disc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you have two drives: Insert the MD3 disc in drive B: and type
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
MD3TRANS B: A:dskfile
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you have one drive: Copy MD3TRANS to the RAM drive
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
COPY MD3TRANS.EXE C:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\family roman
then insert your MD3 disc and run MD3TRANS
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family roman
then insert your boot disc and copy the resulting file back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
COPY C:dskfile A:

Problems reading floppies on Windows 9x
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On some versions of Windows 95, 98 or ME, JOYCE has trouble creating disc
 image files.
 The transfer appears to work, but runs very very slowly; and the resulting
 .DSK file is blank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get round this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Open a DOS prompt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to set up a system-wide installation of JOYCE with default
 settings, boot discs and other discs.
 To do this, first set up the desired configuration as a normal user.
 Then copy the following files:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
From 
\family typewriter
~user/Joyce
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
/usr/local/share/Joyce
\family default
: 
\family typewriter
joycehw.xml
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
From 
\family typewriter
~user/Joyce/Boot
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
/usr/local/share/Joyce/Boot
\family default
: 
\family typewriter
boot*.dsk
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
joycebt.xml
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
From 
\family typewriter
~user/Joyce/Disks
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
/usr/local/share/Joyce/Disks
\family default
: Any other .dsk files that should be common.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will then become the default configuration on your system.
 Users will still be able to change settings or add additional discs; these
 will be saved to their local configuration directories.

Note that many of these keys don't exist in a standard PC keyboard.
 For example, the PC keyboard has no

 no effect.

\begin_layout Standard
This version of JOYCE could not have been written without:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ian Collier, who wrote the "xz80" emulator.
 The Z80 emulator in JOYCE is based on the one in xz80.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Richard Clayton, who supplied vital information on the interactions between
 the XBIOS and the hardware.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cliff Lawson, who made the PCW hardware specification public.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Richard Fairhurst and Jacob Nevins, who provided hardware information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The many authors of Linux, GNU, gcc, SDL, libpng and libxml.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The MICO authors who created the mini-STL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Frank D.
 Cringle, who wrote the Z80 emulator test suite in YAZE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
David Cantrell, for his posting on comp.sys.amstrad.8bit describing the use
 of PostScript in printer emulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Matthew Gomez, who suggested some of the colour names in the custom colour

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Digital Research, the original authors of CP/M, GEM and GSX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Caldera (as was; it later ended up as Lineo), for releasing GEM under the
 GPL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Everyone who over the years has spared the time to contact me about JOYCE,
 in particular those who found incompatibilities in the emulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Previous versions also owed much to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Marat Fayzullin, who wrote the original Z80 emulation code.
 However, none of this code now remains in JOYCE, because it is not compatible
 with the GPL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ian Macdonald, who tested JOYCE for DOS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The authors of DJGPP, GRX20 and DRDOS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Samuel Vincent, the author of the SVAsync library.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
