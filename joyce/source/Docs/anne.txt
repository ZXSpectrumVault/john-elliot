  What ANNE does

ANNE emulates a PcW16 computer - an 8-bit computer intended by 
Amstrad as a word processor, and manufactured around 1996.

  What's new?

  Since v2.2.0:

  JOYCE will now prompt you when a CP/M program attempts to 
  access files outside the emulator (for example, the supplied 
  IMPORT or EXPORT utilities). This warning can be controlled 
  from f6=Settings | General | File Access...

  The Windows version is distributed with the latest SDL.DLL.

  Various compilation fixes on Unix platforms.

  Since v2.1.0:

  A crash that occurs when trying to load the rescue disc has 
  been corrected.

  Initial support for compiling under Mac OS X has been added.

  It is now possible to use a folder on the host computer as a 
  CP/M disc. 

  Native GSX support is now present.

  Can now boot CP/M.

  Successfully detects when a disc image has been changed.

  Does not let the mouse pointer go off the bottom of the PcW16 
  screen.

  Installation from a .CFI file (rather than a physical PcW16 
  rescue disc) now works correctly.

  With graphics acceleration turned on, the word processor 
  display is not corrupted by scrolling.

  Floppy acceleration is a whole lot better than it was before.

  When you create a new disc image file, you will be asked 
  whether it should be 720k or 1.4Mb. It will then be formatted, 
  so you don't have to use the PcW16 file manager to format new 
  discs. Instead, answer yes when it asks you if you want to 
  create PcW16 folders on the disc.

  <sec: concepts>Concepts

When moving from a PcW to an emulator, the biggest change you 
have to accustom yourself to is the way that ANNE handles discs. 
Real PcW16s use real floppy discs[footnote:
The PCW16 design allowed a hard drive interface to be added. ANNE 
does not emulate this.
]; you use the recovery disc to reload the system after a crash, 
a data disc to save your work on, and so on.

It is possible for ANNE to use real disc drives in the same way 
that a PcW does. However this is pretty slow and awkward; since 
the PC's got a hard drive, you might as well use it. 

  Disc image files

Each floppy disc is read into the PC's hard drive and stored as a 
“disc image file”. This is a one-time process; once the disc 
image files are created, the discs themselves are no longer 
needed. 

Disc image files have a number of advantages:

  They are much faster than real floppy discs.

  You don't have to be shuffling a stack of floppies every time 
  you want to use ANNE.

  If you want more discs, you don't have to go to the shop to buy 
  them. You just create more disc image files.

By convention, these have names ending in “.dsk”. So instead of 
having a “manuscripts” disc, you would have a disc image file 
called “manuscripts.dsk”. To normal Unix or Windows software, “
manuscripts.dsk” is just one file, but PcW programs see it as a 
disc with any number of PcW files on it.

One consequence of this is that the PcW16's floppy drive has 
nothing to do with your PC's real floppy drives. You can be 
working with a “disc” in the PcW's drive even when there's 
nothing in your real floppy drive(s). 

Converting your PcW discs to disc image files is covered in 
section [sec: setup].

  Disc image folders

ANNE 2.1.8 and later can use folders instead of CP/M disc image 
files. In this system, one PcW disc corresponds to one PC folder. 
This has the advantage that each PcW file corresponds exactly to 
one PC file. For example, you could put text files in that 
folder, and then use the PcW's “Import” facility to import files 
from them.

  Floppy Acceleration

When you have floppy acceleration turned on, ANNE doesn't use 
disc images any more. When programs refer to the 'disc drive', 
they are actually looking at a directory called PcW16FS on your 
hard drive. This is more convenient if you want to share files 
between the PcW16 environment and the rest of the world, and you 
don't have to worry about disc images only holding 1.4Mb.

  ROMs

A real PcW16 has 1 megabyte of flash ROM, which holds the 
contents of the Cabinet, the built-in software, and the user 
settings. In the case of a program crash, the contents of the 
flash ROM could be lost, forcing a time-consuming reload from the 
recovery disc and data backups.

ANNE doesn't just use one flash ROM - it allows you to choose 
from several. One (called “Previous session”) is automatically 
saved when you leave ANNE; another (“Empty system”) is created 
when the recovery disc is first read in. It is possible to save 
others at any time; for example, if you have a Cabinet full of 
documents, you can save a copy of the ROM, and revert to that 
later if something goes wrong. 

  The MENU key

ANNE requires a Windows-style keyboard with a Menu key. On most 
keyboards, Menu is between AltGr and Ctrl, to the right of the 
space bar. Under Mac OS X, there is no Menu key (even if you've 
plugged in a PC keyboard, SDL doesn't recognise the key) and you 
should use Command-F9 (Windows+F9 on a PC keyboard) instead.

  Compiling ANNE

If you have downloaded ANNE as a binary for your platform (eg: 
the full Windows install, or an RPM), you can skip this section.

To compile ANNE, you will need:

  SDL, the Simple DirectMedia Layer: <http://www.libsdl.org>. You 
  need version 1.0.8 or later.

  libxml, the xml parser used by GNOME <http://www.libxml.org/>. 
  ANNE was tested with version 2.2.6.

  libpng, the image library. <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/>. 
  You need version 1.0.6 or later.

You should be able to compile with the commands:

./configure

make

sudo make install 

On systems with a GCC version earlier than 3.0, the first line 
should be “./configure --with-ministl”.

To cross-compile ANNE for Windows, you need the XMINGW32 
cross-compiler pack from <http://www.libsdl.org>, and MINGW32 
versions of the above libraries.

  ANNE on Mac OS X

I have successfully compiled ANNE on a Mac OS X (10.4.2) system. 
The process (and indeed MacOS X support in general) is pretty new 
and unpolished.

Firstly, the three libraries mentioned above (SDL, libxml and 
libpng) had to be compiled from source and installed using their “
make install” commands; pre-packaged OS X versions didn't seem to 
be suitable. 

Secondly, the configure script needed to be told what the host 
system was:

./configure --host=powerpc-darwin-apple8.2.2

make

sudo make install

Thirdly, this builds an ANNE that is still very much a UNIX 
application; there's no application icon, no native OS X menu, 
and so on. 



  Known bugs

This version of ANNE contains, or is thought to contain, the 
following bugs:

  Under MacOS X in full-screen mode, the mouse pointer can leave 
  stray pixels where it has been.

  The serial port support is untested. It is possible to use 
  QTERM under CP/M, but the SIO device driver (SIO.FID) has not 
  been tested.

  The emulated PcW hangs if, from the front screen, you click 
  'Help' then 'Index'.

  Internet resources

The latest versions of ANNE- and any future updates - will be 
downloadable as part of the JOYCE suite, from 
<http://www.seasip.info/Unix/Joyce/>.

Announcements of new ANNE releases, if any, will be made to the 
newsgroup <news:comp.sys.amstrad.8bit>. It is also on-topic to 
discuss ANNE in this newsgroup.

  <sec: setup>Setting Up

  Directory organisation

  Under Windows

ANNE uses the same directories as its sister emulator JOYCE. 
These comprise two directories - a “system” directory common to 
all users (eg, “C:/Program Files/Joyce/lib” and a “user” 
directory (eg: “C:/My Documents/Joyce”). Each of these 
directories will have subdirectories called Boot (boot files and 
boot disc images) and Disks (all other disc images). In the 
remainder of this document you will see directory names which 
look like “~/Joyce/Boot”; you should take the “~” to stand for 
the “My Documents” directory.

If you don't want ANNE to put its files in “My Documents”, then 
you can override it. In ANNE, press [f9] for the menu, [f6] for 
settings, and select “General”. Then enter the new directory 
name, and press RETURN. You will need to copy the “Joyce” 
directory from “My Documents” to the new directory you specified.

  Under Unix

ANNE uses two directories - a “system” directory common to all 
users (by default, /usr/local/share/Joyce - see Appendix [sec: admins]
) and a “user” directory for each user (by default, ~/Joyce). 
Each of these directories will have subdirectories called Boot 
(boot files and boot disc images) and Disks (all other disc 
images).

  Running ANNE for the first time

  You will need:

  A version of ANNE that installed correctly. 

  A screen capable of 800x600x256 graphics. ANNE may well be 
  faster in 256 colour mode than in (say) 16-bit mode. 

  One of the following: 

  A PcW16 rescue disc; 

  A disc image of the PcW16 rescue disc, that you previously 
    generated;

  The rescue disc in .CFI format from Cliff Lawson's web page: 
    <http://web.ukonline.co.uk/cliff.lawson/files/pcwos.zip>

  The ANNE command

Under Windows, ANNE should be run from the Start Menu. Under 
Unix, the command to use is either “xanne” (to run in a window) 
or “xanne -f” (to run full screen). Other command line options 
are given in section [sec: cmdline].

  <sec: addboot>Adding boot ROMs

The first time ANNE is started, it will detect that no boot ROM 
is present. You will be asked to provide it with a rescue disc. 

The next menu that appears asks you for the location of the 
rescue disc to use. 

  If you are using real floppies, then select the correct drive 
  (A: or B:). 

  If you are using a pre-prepared DSK file, choose the correct 
  file. 

  If you are using a .CFI file, choose the file and then select “
  Advanced”. On the menu that appears, select “.CFI - compressed 
  raw”.

Next select “Continue”. If all goes well, the boot ROM will now 
be created and the boot menu will appear. The only usable option 
will be “Empty system (Boot ROM only”) so select that. 

You should then see the PcW16 memory test, followed by the “Fatal 
OS checksum error” message. Use the ANNE menu (see below) to 
insert the rescue disc again, and click the “power switch” icon. 
If you get a “Disk bootstrap error”, click the power switch 
again.

When the OS install is complete and you have entered your user 
details, use the ANNE menu to save the current system as a boot 
ROM (f2=Disc; Disc management; Save current ROM as boot ROM). 
Call it something like “Full system”.

  Running ANNE for the second and subsequent times

When ANNE has been set up, it will display a boot menu when 
started. The menu will offer the following options:

  Previous session The ROM saved when you last used ANNE. You 
  would normally choose this option, unless the session has been 
  corrupted by a program crash or you want to load an alternative 
  ROM.

  n. title ROMs that have been saved at earlier points. There 
  will usually be one called “Empty system”, representing the 
  state of the system just before the recovery disc is loaded. 

  Other... Load a ROM from a disc file.

  In Use

  What is emulated

  The Z80. 

  2MB of memory and 2MB of Flash ROM.

  The screen. 

  The keyboard. 

  The real-time clock 

  A Centronics-only printer interface. You can print to a disc 
  file or a UNIX command (eg, “lpr” for direct printer output). 

  The mouse (either attached to a COM port, or directly driven). 
  You will need a three-button mouse for the full effect.

  The serial ports (emulation of these is rather sketchy)

  The beeper.

  The LocoLink interface (over the parallel port).

  What is not emulated

  The optional hard drive.

  <sec: morediscs>How the disc drive is handled

The basic concept of disc image files was described in section [sec: concepts]
. There are several subtleties to be aware of:

  Ejecting a disc

To eject a disc, press the MENU key (OS X: Command+F9) for the 
ANNE menu, then [f2] (Disc). If there is a disc in the PCW16's 
drive, you can eject it by selecting the corresponding “eject” 
option. Remember that ejecting discs from ANNE's emulated drive 
doesn't have anything to do with whatever floppy drives are 
actually fitted to the PC.

  <sec: cmdline>Command-line options

If you want ANNE to start with a disc in its emulated drive, then 
use -A with a filename:

xanne -A documents.dsk

will start up with "documents.dsk”. in the drive. 

To start up without asking which boot ROM to use, use the -E 
option with a filename:

xanne -E bootfile.rom

  Non-floppy discs

The following JOYCE utilities have not been tested on ANNE. Some 
may work.

  ANNEDRV.FID gives the emulated PcW16 a hard drive (available 
  only under CP/M). It uses a similar "disc image file" system to 
  the floppy drives, but the image files can be up to 8Mb in 
  size.

  REDIR.COM allows you to use one or more Unix directories as 
  CP/M drives. It requires CP/M. This avoids the problem that the 
  host PC can't see "inside" image files without extra software.

  IMPORT.COM and EXPORT.COM will copy single files into or out of 
  the ANNE environment. They require CP/M.

All these utilities are on the file ANNEUTIL.DSK. You can get at 
them with a command something like:

xanne -A=/usr/local/lib/Joyce/Disks/anneutil.dsk

and then start CP/M using “Run external program”. REDIR.COM and 
its companion programs are in Group 1; the others are in Group 0.

  Floppy Disc Acceleration

As mentioned in section [sec: concepts], floppy disc acceleration 
makes a directory on your hard drive appear to be the PcW16 
floppy drive. This does not work with CP/M; for CP/M discs, use 
the “Folder” option in the “Enter filename for disc image” menu. 

  What if the speed is wrong? 

  If ANNE is too slow

One solution is to increase the CPU speed. Press [MENU], then 
[f6] and select 'General'. Then enter the new speed.

It may also be possible to improve the performance of ANNE by 
changing the video refresh frequency. This is normally 12, but it 
can be reduced to improve performance. If it is reduced to 3.75, 
for example, then programs may appear a little jerky, but ANNE 
should run at its full speed.

To change the video refresh frequency, start ANNE. At the opening 
screen, press [MENU], then [f6] and select 'Video'. Then enter 
the new frequency and press RETURN.

  If ANNE is too fast

The built-in speed regulation in ANNE should stop it running too 
fast. Possibly you could reduce the overall speed: press [MENU], 
then [f6] and select 'General'. Then enter a new speed.

  Peripherals in ANNE

  The keyboard

The keyboard is laid out to match the PcW16's own keyboard - a 
UK-layout 102-key arrangement. The following keys have different 
captions on the PcW16:

[This is for a UK keyboard with XFree86. Other X servers may 
behave differently].

+--------------+----------+--------------------------------+






  <sec: mousetypes>The Mouse

The PcW16 uses a Mouse Systems type mouse, connected to its 
second serial port (referred to by ANNE as COM3:). ANNE can 
emulate the mouse as either:

  No emulated mouse. 

  Serial mouse on COM1 (the mouse is in the wrong socket)

  Serial mouse on COM3 (the mouse is in the right socket)

  Update ROSANNE directly (the ROSANNE mouse coordinates are 
  updated directly, which produces much better results than the 
  emulated serial mouse options)

To choose which emulation is selected, press [MENU] in ANNE; then 
[f6] for Settings, and choose Mouse. 

It is possible to use ANNE with a real PcW16 (or compatible) 
mouse - any serial mouse that uses the MouseSystems protocol 
should be suitable. To do this, choose 'No emulated mouse', plug 
the mouse into a serial port, and set the PcW16's COM3 to use 
that port.

  The disc drive

Instead of a real disc drive, ANNE works with “disc image files” 
on the computer's hard drive. These are fully described in 
sections [sec: concepts] and [sec: morediscs]. If Rosanne 
acceleration is turned on (section [sec: accel]), then instead of 
disc image files, ANNE will use a directory on your hard drive.

  The LocoLink interface

ANNE allows two forms of LocoLink communication (only one under 
Windows, though). In each case, you must have suitable software 
(LocoLink or PcWLink). 

  LocoLink to a real computer (requires Linux)

  ANNE will act as the master. Connect the parallel port of your 
  Linux box to the other computer (if it's another PC, use a 
  LapLink cable; if it's a PcW, use the original LocoLink cable). 
  Go into the settings for the printer port, and set it to “
  Output to parallel port”. Then select the appropriate parallel 
  port (normally /dev/parport0 or /dev/parport1).

  LocoLink to another emulator

  Go into the settings for the printer port and set it to “output 
  to Socket”. On the screen that appears, select the correct 
  socket type and name (see below) and ensure the “Client 
  (Normal)” option is ticked.

  Socket types and names

  UNIX domain sockets (not supported on Windows) can be used to 
  communicate with other emulators on the same computer. They 
  work pretty much like normal files, and their names are normal 
  filenames; so, for example, one might be called “
  /tmp/locolink.socket”. When you are establishing a link, it is 
  important that both ends are using the same socket name.

  TCP/IP sockets can be used to communicate with other emulators 
  not only on the same computer, but across a network or the 
  Internet. However, ANNE does not perform any security checks on 
  socket connections, so I strongly recommend that you do not use 
  TCP/IP sockets while connected to the Internet. 

  For a LocoLink master, the name of a TCP/IP socket is formed “
  host:port” - for example, “localhost:8256”, “127.0.0.1:8512” or 
  even “www.somewhere.com.invalid:8080”. 

  The ANNE Menu

If you press the Menu key (OS X: Command+F9), a menu will appear 
at the top of the screen. It offers the following options:

  ESC=return to ANNE

Leaves the menu system.

  f1 = Help

Display the keyboard layout onscreen.

  f2 = Discs

Options for the floppy drive. Use this to "insert" and "eject" 
discs, to read floppy discs into the ANNE environment, and to 
modify boot ROM settings. It brings up the Discs menu below.

  f5 = Reboot

Simulates turning the PcW off and then on again.

  f6 = Settings

Settings for all aspects of the emulator. The Settings menu will 
appear.

  f7 = Debug

Display the Debug menu ([sec: dbgmenu]). 

  f8 = Action

Display the Action menu ([sub:The-Action-Menu]).

  f10 = Quit

Leave ANNE. You will be asked for confirmation. Under OS X, use 
Command+F10, because F10 by itself triggers Exposé.

  <sub:The-Action-Menu>The Action Menu

This menu has only one option: “Select PCW screen.” This is 
intended for use with GSX programs (such as DR Graph) which exit 
without shutting GSX down properly. In such cases, the program 
will appear to hang, but selecting the PCW screen will display 
the A> prompt.

  <sec: dbgmenu>The Debug Menu

There are four options here, intended mainly for advanced users 
or ANNE developers. 

  “Debug mode” puts the system in debug mode. This has no effect 
  in the current release.

  “CPU state” displays the values of the Z80 registers.

  “RAM dump” writes out the contents of RAM to a file in the 
  current directory called “anne.ram”. This is not a full 
  snapshot facility; memory dumps can't be reloaded, and they 
  don't contain CPU state.

  “Power switch” simulates the power switch being pressed or 
  released.

  The Disks menu

The Disks menu displays the status of the floppy drives, and 
allows you to eject or insert discs. Each drive has three lines 
in the menu:

  The first line reads either “Drive A: (Ejected)” or “Drive A: 
  (Filename)”. This shows whether there is a “disc” (.DSK file) 
  in the drive or not.

  The second line reads either “Eject” or “Insert...” depending 
  whether there's a disc in the drive. “Eject” ejects the current 
  disc (.DSK file); while “Insert...” brings up a window asking 
  for the file to insert. You can also “insert” a real floppy 
  drive; this allows the emulated PcW to access a real drive 
  directly (if slowly). If you change the disc in the real drive, 
  you may need to “eject” and “insert” the real drive, so that 
  the PcW's own software can tell that the disc has changed. If 
  you ask to “insert” a folder, and the folder you select has not 
  previously been used in this way by JOYCE or ANNE, then you 
  will be asked what format the folder should pretend to be in.

  The bottom line for each drive reads “Read only”. If there is a 
  tick beside it then the write protect holes on the disc have 
  been opened and it cannot be written to.

  If you select“Disc management...” then a menu appears allowing 
  you to read in extra floppy discs, or convert .DSK files back 
  to real discs.

  The Disc Management menu

There are six options:

  Add a boot ROM from a file - Reads in a boot ROM and adds it to 
  the opening menu.

  Save current ROM as boot ROM - Saves the current ROM file and 
  adds it to the opening menu.

  Rename a boot ROM - Allows you to change the caption associated 
  with a boot ROM.

  Delete a boot ROM - Removes a boot ROM from the opening menu. 
  Use this option with caution!

  Convert floppy to ANNE.DSK file - Read in a normal (data) disc, 
  storing the new disc image file in the “user discs” directory.

  Write .DSK file back out to floppy - Convert a disc image file 
  (either normal or start-of-day) back to a floppy disc.

  The Settings menu

Choose the item of hardware for which you want to make changes. 
Note that if you make a change such as disconnecting or 
connecting an interface, the emulated PcW may not pick it up 
until the next reboot. 

  Disc drives

Note: The menus in this section only allows you to create 
configurations that could exist on a real PcW16. By manually 
editing ~/Joyce/annehw.xml, you can create “impossible” 
configurations, such as a system with two floppy drives (CP/M and 
Rosanne won't detect the second one.) If the configuration is “
impossible”, the menus will look different as they attempt to 
accommodate the changes.

The settings in this menu are:

  Drive A: settings: 

This brings up its own menu, allowing you to set what type of 
disc drive is attached to the PcW. The default type (“720k 3.5”) 
in fact supports 1440k disc images as well. If you want to 
emulate 5.25” drives or anything else unusual, select “other” and 
manually enter the drive type, the number of cylinders[footnote:
The drive documentation may call this figure the number of tracks 
rather than the number of cylinders. Either way, it's usually 40 
or 80.
] it can access, and whether it's single or double-sided.

  <sec: extradrv>Extra drives

This menu allows you to set up drives C: - L: and N: - P:. 
Obviously these drives don't exist on real PcW16s, but they can 
on an ANNE system, though only under CP/M. You will need to have 
a copy of ANNEDRV.FID on your start-of-day disc for these drives 
to become available - see section [sec: joycedrv].

For each drive, you can set it up in three ways:

  As direct access to the PC's floppy drives. 

  As a floppy drive that accesses a standard disc image file, 
  just like the emulated A: drive.

  As a hard drive with 8Mb of storage. The hard drive will also 
  be stored on a .DSK file, but this .DSK file will not be usable 
  in emulated floppy drives.

To set up a drive, choose it from the list. Then choose or enter 
the filename and drive type, as listed below:






+-----------------------------------------+--------------+---------------+
|          Type of drive to use           | Choose file  | Choose option |
+-----------------------------------------+--------------+---------------+
+-----------------------------------------+--------------+---------------+
|         Floppy drive A: or B:           |  A: or B:    | floppy drive  |
+-----------------------------------------+--------------+---------------+
| Floppy drive using standard image file  |  .DSK file   | floppy drive  |
+-----------------------------------------+--------------+---------------+
|  Hard drive using special image file    |  .DSK file   |  hard drive   |
+-----------------------------------------+--------------+---------------+






  Memory

This allows you to set the memory size of your emulated PcW. If 
your computer is running very low on memory, the “Current memory 
size” may be less than requested. 

By default, ANNE uses maximum values - 2Mb of Flash ROM and 2Mb 
of RAM. If you want it to behave like a real PcW16, set both of 
these to 1Mb.

  <sec: genopt>General options

This screen allows you to choose the speed at which ANNE should 
run. It also allows you to control the warning that appears when 
a CP/M program attempts to access files outside the emulator (as, 
for example, the supplied IMPORT and EXPORT utilities do). Select 
“File Access...” and select one of three options:

  Allow full access Programs running under CP/M will be able to 
  read and write any file on your computer, without prompting. 
  This is how ANNE 2.2.6 and previous versions behaved.

  Prompt for each file When a CP/M program attempts to read or 
  write a file, ANNE will display a prompt asking whether this 
  should be allowed (see below).

  No file access CP/M programs will not be able to access 
  arbitrary files on your computer. The IMPORT and EXPORT 
  utilities will not operate.

If 'Prompt for each file' is selected, then when a CP/M program 
attempts to open a file, the following warning will be displayed:

Confirm host file access



A CP/M program is attempting to access the file:

bank_passwords.txt

Do you want to allow access to this file?



No

No, and don't ask again

Yes

The prompt will offer three options:

  No Access to the file will be blocked. You will be prompted 
  again if the program attempts to read or write a different 
  file.

  No, and don't ask again Access to the file will be blocked, and 
  the File Access settings screen will be switched to the “No 
  file access” option, blocking all future file access. If you 
  subsequently want to grant access again, this must be done 
  through the File Access menu screen.

  Yes Access to this file will be allowed. You will be prompted 
  again if the program attempts to read or write a different 
  file.

  Mouse

The mouse settings available here are:

  Emulation mode: No mouse, Mouse on COM1:, Mouse on COM3: and 
  Update ROSANNE directly (see section [sec: mousetypes]).

  Video

The Video settings allow you to change:

  “Video refresh” - the number of times per second that the 
  screen is redrawn. You can go up to 50Hz (ie, the screen is 
  redrawn 50 times a second) or down to 0.01Hz (the screen is 
  drawn once every 10 seconds). The default setting in ANNE is 
  12Hz, which is fine for nearly all programs.

  The beeper is usually emulated using the PC's sound card. You 
  can also have it manifest as a red flash of the screen (“Visual 
  Beeper”) or silence (“Disable beeper”).

  Whether the PcW has a colour monitor (the default), a 
  monochrome white monitor (like the real PcW16) or a monochrome 
  green monitor.

  Printer

The following settings are available for the parallel printer 
port:

  Connected/Disconnected: Is the printer connected to the PcW?

  Output to file: Output goes to a disc file. When you select 
  this option, you are asked for the filename to send the output 
  to.

  Output to UNIX command: Output goes to a Unix pipeline. You can 
  use this to send output to the Unix printing system (enter “lpr”
   here, with any appropriate options).

  Output to parallel port : Output goes to a real live parallel 
  port, with no processing. This can be used to LocoLink to a 
  real PcW.

  Output to socket: Output is sent to another process, over a 
  socket. This can be used to LocoLink to an emulated PcW (using 
  JOYCE v2.1.0).

  Under Windows, you also get the option to send data to LPT 
  ports. 

  Save settings

If you do not save the settings, they will remain in force only 
for the duration of your current ANNE session. The settings will 
be saved to the file Joyce/annehw.xml in your home directory.

  <sec: accel>Rosanne Acceleration

Rosanne Acceleration allows certain functions normally performed 
by the PcW16's Rosanne operating system to be taken over by the 
emulator.

To turn acceleration on, press the Menu key, then [F6] for the 
Settings menu, and select “Rosanne acceleration”. If there is no 
tick by 'Enabled', press SPACE. You will then see a list of 
further options, each of which can be ticked and unticked as 
required. 

In general, acceleration replaces parts of Rosanne with calls to 
special functions in the emulator. This can greatly improve 
performance, though possibly at the cost of compatibility for 
some programs. Rosanne acceleration has been tested on Rosanne 
v1.12; it may or may not work with other versions of Rosanne.

Acceleration must be turned off during a reload from the rescue 
disc.

  Memory Test

Ticking this option will cause the “PLEASE WAIT. CHECKING MEMORY” 
screen to be skipped.

  Floppy disc

If this option is ticked, then instead of using a disc image file 
for its floppy drive, ANNE will use a directory on the hard drive 
( ~/Joyce/PcW16FS). This has a number of advantages:

  It's faster.

  You can get files in and out of the PcW16 environment much more 
  easily.

  The resulting drive is not limited to 1.4Mb. 

The directory does not have to exist; to create it, turn on 
floppy disc acceleration, go into the File Manager, and press 
Control-L. 

Note that when floppy disc acceleration is turned on, asking ANNE 
to insert or remove disc images will have no effect.

  Graphics

If this option is ticked, several low-level graphics operations 
will be implemented in native code. This considerably improves 
the speed of drawing of menus, dialogs, and those huge buttons on 
the front screen.

  ANNE Utilites

The following utility programs are supplied with ANNE. They are 
designed to access features of the emulator which have no 
equivalent on a real PcW. You will find them on the disc image “
utils16.dsk”.

  <sec: joycedrv>ANNEDRV

ANNEDRV.FID is a file which is used to add one or more extra disc 
drives to CP/M running within ANNE. The first of these drives 
will usually be drive C:.

Unless the settings are changed (see section [sec: extradrv]) the 
drives will be set up as 8Mb hard drives, called 
~/Joyce/Disks/c.dsk, ~/Joyce/Disks/d.dsk, etc. This can be used 
to share files between an install of JOYCE and an install of 
ANNE. The drives cannot be accessed from Rosanne.

  DDJOYCE.PRL

DDJOYCE is new in v2.1.7. It is a GSX driver for the host PC's 
graphics screen, allowing high-resolution colour graphics to be 
used from CP/M.

To use it, edit your ASSIGN.SYS file. Remove the entry which 
reads

01 @:DDSCREEN

and replace it by

01 @:DDJOYCE

DDJOYCE has been tested with the Digital Research programs DR 
Draw and DR Graph, with the following issues:

  My copy of DR Graph insists on trying to access drive B: all 
  the time, causing invisible “Please insert the disc for drive 
  B:” messages. The program then appears to hang until you press 
  RETURN to acknowledge the message.

  When DR Graph shuts down, the screen goes blank. This is 
  because DR Graph does not make a proper 'close workstation' 
  call when it terminates. Use the Action menu to switch back to 
  the PcW16 screen.

  DR Draw works correctly, though text rendering is rather ugly.

  DOSDIR

DOSDIR displays the contents of a directory in the host 
filesystem (the name DOSDIR is for compatibility with MYZ80). 
Syntax is:

     DOSDIR

  or DOSDIR {x:/path/}filespec

Note that if you include a path you must include a filename. The 
command

     DOSDIR C:/IMAGES/       is invalid, but

     DOSDIR C:/IMAGES/*.*    is valid.

To get lower-case commands, use:

     A>DOSDIR \

     DOSDIR>/usr/local/bin/* 

  EMULIOS.RSX

EMULIOS allows Digital Research Logo to use the 800x600 screen.

To set it up, use the following commands (under CP/M):

PIP EMULOGO.COM=LOGO.COM

GENCOM EMULOGO

GENCOM EMULOGO EMULIOS

- Then EMULOGO.COM will behave as LOGO.COM, but using the 800x600 
screen.

The following commands will behave differently:

  setpc Allows a number from 0 to 255

  setbg Allows a number from 0 to 255

  savepic The .PIC file saved is in Windows BMP format, and can 
  be exported, renamed to .BMP, and loaded by paint programs.

  loadpic The .PIC file loaded must be in Windows BMP format and 
  have 256 colours, but its size does not have to be 800x600.

  EXPORT

EXPORT will write CP/M files out as UNIX files. It respects exact 
file sizes.

The syntax is:

     EXPORT cpmfile                    { [O] }

     EXPORT unixfile=du:cpmfile        { [O] }

The first form of the command produce a UNIX file with the same 
name as the CP/M file. 

The second form creates a UNIX file with a name that may be 
different from the CP/M name.

If you're using UNIX rather than Windows, beware: because the 
CP/M CCP renders all filenames into uppercase, it's very unlikely 
you'll be able to pass directory names to EXPORT; if you say

     EXPORT /home/fred/cpmfile

EXPORT.COM will see "/HOME/FRED/CPMFILE", which probably won't 
exist. To get

round this, use:

     A>EXPORT \

     EXPORT>/home/fred/cpmfile

  IMPORT

IMPORT will read UNIX files into the CP/M filesystem. It sets 
exact file sizes.

The syntax is:

     IMPORT {/path/}hostfile            { [O] }

     IMPORT du:=/path/hostfile          { [O] }

     IMPORT du:cpmfile=x:/path/hostfile { [O] }

The first form imports the named file (or files) to the current 
drive and user area.

The second form imports the file (or files) to the specified 
drive and user area, keeping the original name(s).

The third form imports the files, changing their name(s) to match 
the provided CP/M filename(s).

If the [O] option is present, existing CP/M files with the same 
name as an imported file will be overwritten without asking. 
Otherwise you are asked for confirmation.

Both filenames may include wildcards, and the second and third 
forms can include CP/M driveletters and user numbers:

     A:IMPORT \

     IMPORT>2F:*.ASC=/usr/doc/*.txt

will import all the .txt files in /usr/doc to drive F, group 2.

Filenames are expanded case-sensitively, so you will normally 
need to use the backslash, as above, to get lower-case letters 
into the command line.

  QUIT

Syntax: 

QUIT { number } { [O] }

QUIT will exit ANNE. With no parameters, it will check whether 
there are files on drive M: which may need saving, and if there 
are it will ask for confirmation.

The number parameter is the error level which ANNE should return. 
If there is no number parameter, ANNE returns 98.

The [O] option disables the M: drive check and quits immediately.

  REDIR

REDIR allows you to use one or more PC directories as drives 
under CP/M. See the separate file REDIR.DOC for more information.

  VGA and VGACOM

VGA.FID allows CP/M programs to make direct use of the PC screen 
and keyboard. This gives more text on the screen and faster 
output.

Once VGA.FID has loaded, type VGACOM ON to activate it, and 
VGACOM OFF to deactivate it.

Your PcW screen will now be 100 columns x 36 lines. Nearly all 
the normal PcW escape codes are supported, which should enable 
character-based programs to be run. Since screen output is now 
being done by the host PC's processor, you should notice an 
improvement in speed.

The following escape codes work differently in the 800x600 VGA 
mode:

  ESC b / ESC c set colours (so the numbers in the PALETTE 
  command actually have meaning).

  ESC y sets 32x90 mode.

  ESC z sets 36x100 mode.

  ANNE utilities (PC hosted)

If you don't want to use ANNE's own methods for converting 
between disc files and image files, you can also use the dsktrans 
program, which is installed with ANNE.

The command to use is either:

dsktrans /dev/fdn dskfile 

    - Floppy disc to image file

or 

dsktrans dskfile /dev/fdn -otype floppy 

    - Image to floppy disc.

DSKTRANS isn't as versatile as CPCTRANS (for example, it can only 
handle discs in recognisable PcW or +3DOS formats) but it doesn't 
need telling what sort of disc it is using, and it is a native 
(not DOS-hosted) program.

  <sec: admins>For Unix system administrators

First and foremost, don't run ANNE as the root user! ANNE gives 
the PcW programs within it various methods to access the host 
filesystem; it is entirely possible that a malicious PcW program 
running within ANNE could damage important Unix files. 

It is possible to set up a system-wide installation of ANNE with 
default settings, boot discs and other discs. To do this, first 
set up the desired configuration as a normal user. Then copy the 
following files:

  From ~user/Joyce to /usr/local/share/Joyce: annehw.xml

  From ~user/Joyce/Boot to /usr/local/share/Joyce/Boot: anne*.rom 
  and annebt.xml

  From ~user/Joyce/Disks to /usr/local/share/Joyce/Disks: Any 
  other .dsk files that should be common.

This will then become the default configuration on your system. 
Users will still be able to change settings or add additional 
discs; these will be saved to their local configuration 
directories.

  <keycodes>Keyboard codes

Note that many of these keys don't exist in a standard PC 
keyboard. For example, the PC keyboard has no “$” key (it uses 
SHIFT + 4 instead) so assigning codes to that key will have no 
effect.

  Ian Collier, who wrote the “xz80" emulator. The Z80 emulator in 
  ANNE is based on the one in xz80.

  Richard Clayton, who supplied vital information on the 
  interactions between the XBIOS and the hardware.

  Cliff Lawson, who made the PcW hardware specification public.

  Richard Fairhurst and Jacob Nevins, who provided hardware 
  information.

  The many authors of Linux, GNU, gcc, SDL, libpng and libxml.

  The MICO authors who created the mini-STL.

  Frank D. Cringle, who wrote the Z80 emulator test suite in 
  YAZE.

  David Cantrell, for his posting on comp.sys.amstrad.8bit 
  describing the use of PostScript in printer emulation.

  Matthew Gomez, who suggested some of the colour names in the 
  custom colour menu.

  Kevin Thacker, who wrote the PCW16 driver for MESS. I haven't 
  used any MESS code, but it helped a lot knowing what hardware 
  was being used.

  “foz”, for helpful bug reports.

  Digital Research, the original authors of CP/M, GSX and GEM.

  Caldera (as it then was; later Lineo), for releasing GEM source 
  under the GPL.

  Previous versions of JOYCE also owed much to:

  Marat Fayzullin, who wrote the original Z80 emulation code. 
  However, none of this code now remains in ANNE, because it is 
  not compatible with the GPL.

  Ian Macdonald, who tested JOYCE for DOS.

  The authors of DJGPP, GRX20 and DRDOS.

  Samuel Vincent, the author of the SVAsync library.

  Martynas Kunigelis, on whose DJGPP keyboard driver I based that 
  of JOYCE for DOS.
