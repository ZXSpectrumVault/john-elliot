JOYCE v2.2.8

John Elliott

Abstract

JOYCE is an Amstrad PCW emulator for UNIX and Windows. It 
emulates the PCW 8000, 9000 and 10 series computers, but not the 
PCW 16; see ANNE for PCW16 emulation.

  What JOYCE does

JOYCE emulates a PCW computer (8000, 9000 or 10 series). Run it, 
and your Unix or Windows computer becomes a PCW.

  What's new?

  Since v2.2.0

  JOYCE now emulates the Electric Studio light pen.

  JOYCE will now prompt you when a CP/M program attempts to 
  access files outside the emulator (for example, the supplied 
  IMPORT or EXPORT utilities). This warning can be controlled 
  from f6=Settings | General | File Access...

  The Windows version is distributed with the latest SDL.DLL.

  Keyboard emulation has been made more accurate; the three 
  keyboard option links are now emulated.

  The underlying libdsk and lib765 libraries have been updated.

  Since v2.1.0

  A bug in the Z80 emulation which caused Starglider to hang has 
  been corrected.

  The PCKEY utility (in JOYCE) did not work. It has been 
  repaired.

  Initial support for compiling under MacOS X has been added.

  The ability to present a folder on the host computer as a PCW 
  drive, without any additional PCW software. This is still a 
  very new experimental feature -- use it with caution!

  Native LOGO support has been corrected and should now work.

  Native GSX support has been restored, based on original Digital 
  Research source code. 

  Various bugfixes in the floppy drive emulation.

  JOYCE doesn't hang if Trivial Pursuit is run with the emulated 
  CPS8256 interface attached.

  JOYCE now emulates several joystick models.

  The code has been updated to compile without modification on 
  systems with GCC 3.x and SDL 1.2.6.

  A bug has been fixed in the creation of new .DSK files.

  Garbled text in the boot screen has been fixed.

  The utility .DSKs provided actually contain all the files they 
  should.

  Windows GDI printing was printing at a third of the correct 
  size; this has been corrected.

  Help text corrected if you press F1 on the boot screen.

  The Windows version now works if there are no printers set up 
  on the system.

  Since v2.0.0

  Some internal structural changes. 

  LocoLink can be emulated using the parallel port (only under 
  Linux 2.4 or later), Unix domain sockets, or TCP/IP.

  The built-in printer emulations support direct printing under 
  Windows.

  All the utility programs have been rewritten to cross-build 
  under Unix rather than natively under CP/M. This may introduce 
  some instabilities.

  Since earlier versions

See section [sec: changes]. 

  <sec: concepts>Concepts

When moving from a PCW to an emulator, the biggest change you 
have to accustom yourself to is the way that JOYCE handles discs. 
Real PCWs (except the few with add-on hard drives) use real 
floppy discs; you use a start-of-day disc to use LocoScript or 
MicroDesign, a data disc to save your work on, and so on.

It is possible for JOYCE to use real disc drives in the same way 
that a PCW does. However this is pretty slow and awkward; since 
the PC's got a hard drive, you might as well use it. 

  Disc image files

PCW programs can't generally use the PC's hard drive directly. 
For one thing, it's too big; and for another, it's not in CP/M 
format[footnote:
If you do happen to have a CP/M partition on your hard drive, I 
don't want to know. JOYCE still won't use it.
]. Instead, JOYCE creates one or more “disc image files”. Each of 
these is the equivalent of one real PCW disc.

Disc image files have a number of advantages:

  They are much faster than real floppy discs.

  You don't have to be shuffling a stack of floppies every time 
  you want to use JOYCE.

  If you want more discs, you don't have to go to the shop to buy 
  them. You just create more disc image files.

By convention, these have names ending in “.dsk”. So instead of 
having a “manuscripts” disc, you would have a disc image file 
called “manuscripts.dsk”. To normal Unix or Windows software, “
manuscripts.dsk” is just one file, but PCW programs see it as a 
disc with any number of PCW files on it.

One consequence of this is that the PCW's “A” and “B” drives have 
nothing to do with your PC's real floppy drives. The emulated PCW 
can be happily using a disc in its “B” drive even if your PC has 
only one drive.

Converting your PCW discs to disc image files is covered in 
section [sec: setup].

  Disc image folders

JOYCE 2.1.8 and later can also use folders instead of disc image 
files. In this system, one PCW disc corresponds to one PC folder. 
This has the advantage that each PCW file corresponds exactly to 
one PC file. For example, you could instruct the PCW to make 
ASCII files, save them to such a disc/folder, and then read them 
directly with PC software.

  Compiling JOYCE

If you have downloaded JOYCE as a binary for your platform (eg: 
the full Windows install, or an RPM), you can skip this section.

To compile JOYCE, you will need:

  SDL, the Simple DirectMedia Layer: <http://www.libsdl.org>. You 
  need version 1.0.8 or later.

  libxml, the xml parser used by GNOME <http://www.libxml.org/>. 
  JOYCE was tested with version 2.2.6.

  libpng, the image library. <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/>. 
  You need version 1.0.6 or later.

You should be able to compile with the following commands: 

./configure

make

sudo make install 

On systems with a GCC version earlier than 3.0, the first line 
should be “./configure --with-ministl”.

To cross-compile JOYCE for Windows, you need the XMINGW32 
cross-compiler pack from <http://www.libsdl.org>, and MINGW32 
versions of the above libraries.

  JOYCE on Mac OS X

I have successfully compiled JOYCE on a Mac OS X (10.4.2) system. 
The process (and indeed MacOS X support in general) is pretty new 
and unpolished.

Firstly, the three libraries mentioned above (SDL, libxml and 
libpng) had to be compiled from source and installed using their “
make install” commands; pre-packaged OS X versions didn't seem to 
be suitable. 

Secondly, the configure script needed to be told what the host 
system was:

./configure --host=powerpc-darwin-apple8.2.2

make

sudo make install

Thirdly, this builds a JOYCE that is still very much a UNIX 
application; there's no application icon, no native OS X menu, 
and so on.

Finally, OS X uses the [f9] and [f10] keys for Exposé; so you 
will need to use [Command]+[F9] and [Command]+[F10] instead.

  Missing Features

These features were present in JOYCE 1.36 but not in the current 
JOYCE:

  Built-in debugger.

  Internet resources

The latest versions of JOYCE - and any future updates - will be 
downloadable from <http://www.seasip.info/Unix/Joyce/>.

Announcements of new JOYCE releases, if any, will be made to the 
newsgroup <news:comp.sys.amstrad.8bit>. It is also on-topic to 
discuss JOYCE in this newsgroup.

  <sec: setup>Setting Up

  Directory organisation

  Under Windows

JOYCE uses two directories - a “system” directory common to all 
users (eg, “C:/Program Files/Joyce/lib” and a “user” directory 
(eg: “C:/My Documents/Joyce”). Each of these directories will 
have subdirectories called Boot (boot files and boot disc images) 
and Disks (all other disc images). In the remainder of this 
document you will see directory names which look like “
~/Joyce/Boot”; you should take the “~” to stand for the “My 
Documents” directory.

If you don't want JOYCE to put its files in “My Documents”, then 
you can override it. In JOYCE, press [f9] for the menu, [f6] for 
settings, and select “General”. Then enter the new directory 
name, and press RETURN. You will need to copy or move the “Joyce” 
directory from “My Documents” to the new directory you specified.

  Under Unix

JOYCE uses two directories - a “system” directory common to all 
users (by default, /usr/local/share/Joyce - see Appendix [sec: admins]
) and a “user” directory for each user (by default, ~/Joyce). 
Each of these directories will have subdirectories called Boot 
(boot files and boot disc images) and Disks (all other disc 
images).

  Running JOYCE for the first time

  You will need:

  A version of JOYCE that installed correctly. 

  A screen capable of 800x600x256 graphics. JOYCE may well be 
  faster in 256 colour mode than in (say) 16-bit mode. 

  One of the following: 

  At least one 3.5” PCW start-of-day disc; 

  Disc images of PCW start-of-day discs, that you have previously 
    generated;

  A working JOYCE 1.3x installation.

  The JOYCE command

Under Windows, JOYCE should be run from the Start Menu. Under 
Unix, the command to use is either “xjoyce” (to run in a window) 
or “xjoyce -f” (to run full screen). Other command line options 
are given in section [sec: cmdline].

  <sec: addboot>Adding boot discs

The first time JOYCE is started, it will detect that no boot 
discs have been read in. Unless you want to boot laboriously from 
a floppy every time you use JOYCE, you should choose the “set up 
boot discs properly” option.

If you had a previously working JOYCE installation, then this 
will be detected, and you will be given the option to copy boot 
discs from it. If you decide not to to this, you will have to 
provide start-of-day discs or disc image files.

The next menu that appears asks you for the location of the boot 
disc to use. If you are using real floppies, then select the 
correct drive (A: or B:). If you are using pre-prepared DSK 
files, choose the correct file. 

If you are copying a MicroDesign program disc with copy 
protection (or other similar programs such as Tweak3), you will 
also need to click on “Advanced” at this point and select the “
MicroDesign program disc” option. Note that this will not work on 
stock Windows NT, 2000 or XP; see section [sec: md3nt].

Next select “Continue”. You will be asked for a name to give to 
this boot disc (eg: “LocoScript” or “CP/M”). 

Once you have entered the name, the disc is read in and converted 
to a JOYCE .DSK file. If you were copying from a real disc, you 
can put it away when the drive light goes out; JOYCE won't need 
it again.

You can then repeat for as many boot discs as you like.

If you have trouble copying boot discs under Windows 95, 98 or 
ME, then see section [failread] which describes a workaround 
using PCWTRANS.

  After copying boot discs

The JOYCE opening screen will appear, with up to 9 boot discs 
listed on it. If you read in more than 9, press [f3] to see the 
others. Choose the disc you want to use, and the black stripes 
should start to march down the screen.

When you are ready to quit, press [f10].

  Reading in other discs

The JOYCE automatic setup routine only covers start-of-day discs. 
To convert other discs (eg, data discs), press [f9] for the JOYCE 
menu, then [f2] for the Discs menu, and select “Disc Management”. 
From the menu that appears, choose “Convert floppy to JOYCE DSK 
file”. The rest of the procedure is similar to the one for boot 
discs, described in section [sec: addboot].

  What if I haven't got 3.5” start-of-day discs? 

If you have the ability to transfer files to and from your PCW 
(by a serial link or LocoLink, for example) and 1Mb of memory 
(512k for 8000 series PCWs) then you can use DU54 to make the 
disc images. Download DU54 from my website, and use its “Copy” 
option to copy from a disc to a file in CPCEMU format. Then 
transfer the resulting file to your PC. These files will be 
bigger than the floppies they were copied from; so you need a big 
RAMdrive to put them in.

Once you have the files on the PC in CPCEMU format, proceed as 
described in section [sec: addboot], with pre-prepared disc 
images.

  What if I haven't got start-of-day discs at all?

Let me make this clear: I can not supply copies of start-of-day 
discs. My recommendation would be to buy new ones from SD 
Microsystems; contact sdmicro@aol.com.

  In Use

  What is emulated

  The Z80. 

  2MB of memory.

  The screen. 

  The keyboard. 

  The timer. 

  The PCW8256/8512/9256/10 dot-matrix printer. Unless you have a 
  printer that isn't supported by the PCW (eg: the HP Deskjet 
  720C) or you are using software such as LocoScript 1 that 
  doesn't support external printers, I recommend that you use the 
  CPS8256 printer interface instead.

  The PCW9512/9512+ daisywheel printer. The same caveats apply as 
  for the dot-matrix printer.

  The CPS8256 parallel/serial interface. You can print to a disc 
  file or a UNIX command (eg, “lpr” for direct printer output). 
  Serial ports can be mapped to a file or a device node (eg “
  /dev/ttyS0” for direct connection to other computers). 

  A Centronics-only printer interface. You can print to a disc 
  file or a UNIX command (eg, “lpr” for direct printer output). 
  Some CP/M versions cannot detect the Centronics interface; in 
  this case, you should disable it and enable the CPS8256 
  interface instead.

  Most of the floppy disc controller. However, JOYCE has only 
  limited access to the PC's real floppy drive. 

  The mouse (in AMX or Kempston mode). You will need a 
  three-button mouse to use the AMX mode properly - the Microsoft 
  Intellimouse with the scroll wheel is fine. 

  The Electric Studio light pen.

  The PCW9512 PAR port.

  The beeper.

  The LocoLink interface.

  <sec: morediscs>How the disc drives are handled

The basic concept of disc image files was described in section [sec: concepts]
. There are several subtleties to be aware of:

  Boot discs (also known as start-of-day discs)

When JOYCE is started, both disc drives are normally empty. As 
soon as you select which system to boot, the disc image you chose 
(normally named something like ~/Joyce/Boot/boot1.dsk) will be 
inserted in the PCW's A drive. You can add, remove or rename boot 
discs using the Disc Management menu (press [f9] for the JOYCE 
menu, then [f2] (Disc) and choose “Disc Management”).

  Ejecting a disc

To eject a disc, press [f9] for the JOYCE menu, then [f2] (Disc). 
If there is a disc in the PCW's A or B drive, you can eject it by 
selecting the corresponding “eject” option. Remember that 
ejecting discs from JOYCE's emulated drives doesn't have anything 
to do with whatever floppy drives are actually fitted to the PC.

  <sec: cmdline>Command-line options

To start JOYCE and make it automatically boot from one of the 
discs on the boot menu, use:

xjoyce -A #n

for example

xjoyce -A #2

will choose option 2 from the boot menu.

If you want JOYCE automatically to run a boot disc file (not 
necessarily one of the ones on the menu), then use -A with a 
filename:

xjoyce -A locoscript3.dsk

will load "locoscript3.dsk”. 

If you want to start with a floppy disc in drive B:, then use the 
-B command-line option: 

xjoyce -B /home/fred/Joyce/Disks/diskb.dsk

JOYCE can also start an EMS/EMT file directly. To do this, use 
-E:

xjoyce -E /tmp/j14cpm3.ems

You can add a memory-size option to any of the above commands - 
for example, 

xjoyce -A locoscript140.dsk -m 256

will boot from “locoscript140.dsk” with 256k memory (LocoScript 
1.40 malfunctions with the default 2Mb).

  Non-floppy discs

  JOYCEDRV.FID gives the emulated PCW a hard drive, and/or direct 
  access to PCW floppy discs. It requires a recent version of 
  CP/M (BIOS 1.8 or later) or LocoScript 2.30 or later. It uses a 
  similar "disc image file" system to the floppy drives, but the 
  image files can be up to 8Mb in size.

  REDIR.COM allows you to use one or more Unix directories as 
  CP/M drives. It will run under any version of CP/M. This avoids 
  the problem that the host PC can't see "inside" image files 
  without extra software.

  IMPORT.COM and EXPORT.COM will copy single files into or out of 
  the JOYCE environment. They will run under any version of CP/M.

All these utilities are on the file UTILS.DSK. You can get at 
them with a command something like:

xjoyce -B=/usr/local/lib/Joyce/Disks/utils.dsk

and they will appear on drive B:. REDIR.COM and its companion 
programs are in Group 1; the others are in Group 0.

  What if the speed is wrong? 

  If JOYCE is too slow

One solution is to increase the CPU speed. Press [f9], then [f6] 
and select 'General'. Then enter the new speed; since my original 
PCW had a Sprinter, I prefer to run at 200% speed.

It may also be possible to improve the performance of JOYCE by 
changing the video refresh frequency. This is normally 12, but it 
can be reduced to improve performance. If it is reduced to 3.75, 
for example, then programs that use a mouse pointer may appear a 
little jerky, but JOYCE should run at its full speed.

To change the video refresh frequency, start JOYCE. At the 
opening screen, press [f9], then [f6] and select 'Video'. Then 
enter the new frequency and press RETURN.

  If JOYCE is too fast

The built-in speed regulation in JOYCE should stop it running too 
fast. Possibly you could reduce the overall speed: press [f9], 
then [f6] and select 'General'. Then enter a new speed.

  Peripherals in JOYCE

  The keyboard

The PC keyboard is laid out a bit differently from the PCW 
keyboard. The following keys have non-obvious meanings: 

[This is for a UK keyboard with XFree86. Other X servers may 
behave differently].

This is the full keyboard:





<Graphics file: /home/jce/C/Joyce++/Docs/pcwkey.ps>





If you find these mappings inconvenient, you can use PCKEY (on 
the Utilities disc) to change keyboard mappings.

The keyboard has two user-configurable settings. To set them, 
press [f9] in JOYCE; then [f6] for Settings, and choose Keyboard. 

  <sec: keyswap>CTRL / ALT key swapping

There are two ways the CTRL and ALT keys can be set up. These 
are:

  The PC ALT key is used as the PCW ALT key. In this mode the key 
  captions match better than the key positions.

  The PC ALT key is used as the PCW CTRL key. This makes the 
  positions of the keys match better than their captions.

+---------+-------------------+------------------+
|  CTRL   |      EXTRA        |       ALT        |
+---------+-------------------+------------------+






  <sec: keyswap2>Delete key swapping

In the same way, the Backspace and Delete keys can be swapped. 
You may need to use this, depending how your X-Window system is 
configured.

  The Mouse / other pointing device

There were three major types of PCW mouse:

  AMX

  Kempston

  KeyMouse

JOYCE emulates the first two of these; alternatively, it can 
emulate the Electric Studio lightpen. To choose which type is 
selected, press [f9] in JOYCE; then [f6] for Settings, and choose 
Mouse. 

  <sec: mousetypes>AMX mouse 

The AMX mouse emulation is tuned for MicroDesign 3, with the 
mouse movement option set to “Slow”. Most programs support the 
AMX mouse, so this is probably the best choice. However, you will 
need a three-button mouse (or one with a scroll wheel) to use it 
successfully.

  Kempston mouse

The Kempston mouse emulation is designed for Stop Press. Fewer 
programs support the Kempston mouse than the AMX, but it doesn't 
need a three-button mouse.

  Electric Studio lightpen

The lightpen emulation is designed for the programs supplied with 
the lightpen: NEWSDESK, ART and DDESP.PRL. Since the original 
light pen had no switches, the mouse buttons do not do anything; 
you will need to use keys on the keyboard as directed.

  <sec: autopatch>Mouse auto-patch

The Mouse Auto-Patch feature (only available with the AMX mouse 
emulation) is used to improve mouse handling in PCW programs. 
When it is switched on, JOYCE will attempt to link Microdesign, 
Stop Press or Masterpaint directly to the PC's mouse, bypassing 
the normal mouse driver. If successful, this results in smoother 
mouse performance.

When you start the program that uses the mouse, you will see 
either “No mouse patch applied” (in which case, the link could 
not be established) or “Applied program mouse patch” (the link 
was established). 

  The disc drives

Instead of real disc drives, JOYCE works with “disc image files” 
on the computer's hard drive. These are fully described in 
sections [sec: concepts] and [sec: morediscs].

  The LocoLink interface

JOYCE allows two forms of LocoLink communication (only one under 
Windows, though). In each case, you must have suitable software 
(LocoLink or PCWLink). 

  LocoLink to a real computer (requires Linux)

  For JOYCE to act as the slave computer, use a LapLink cable 
  (not the original LocoLink cable) to connect the parallel ports 
  of the two computers being linked. Go into the settings for the 
  LocoLink interface, and set it to “Output to parallel port”, 
  specifying the name of the parallel port device (eg: 
  /dev/parport0).

  For JOYCE to act as the master, connect the parallel port of 
  your Linux box to the other computer (if it's another PC, use a 
  LapLink cable; if it's a PCW, use the original LocoLink cable). 
  Go into the settings for the PAR port, and set it to “Output to 
  parallel port”, as above.

  LocoLink to another emulator

  For JOYCE to act as the slave computer, go into the settings 
  for the LocoLink interface and set it to “output to Socket”. On 
  the screen that appears, select the correct socket type and 
  name (see below) and ensure the “Server (LocoLink slave)” 
  option is ticked.

  For JOYCE to act as the master computer, go into the settings 
  for the PAR port and set it to “output to Socket”. On the 
  screen that appears, select the correct socket type and name 
  (see below) and ensure the “Client (Normal)” option is ticked.

  Socket types and names

  UNIX domain sockets (not supported on Windows) can be used to 
  communicate with other emulators on the same computer. They 
  work pretty much like normal files, and their names are normal 
  filenames; so, for example, one might be called “
  /tmp/locolink.socket”. When you are establishing a link, it is 
  important that both ends are using the same socket name.

  TCP/IP sockets can be used to communicate with other emulators 
  not only on the same computer, but across a network or the 
  Internet. However, JOYCE does not perform any security checks 
  on socket connections, so I strongly recommend that you do not 
  use TCP/IP sockets while connected to the Internet. 

  For a LocoLink master, the name of a TCP/IP socket is formed “
  host:port” - for example, “localhost:8256”, “127.0.0.1:8512” or 
  even “www.somewhere.com.invalid:8080”. 

  For a LocoLink slave, the name of the socket is formed “
  interface:port”. The interface is usually either “127.0.0.1” 
  (accept only connections from this computer) or “0.0.0.0” 
  (accept connections from any computer). 

  The port has to be the same on both master and slave sides of 
  the connection, and the host/interface have to refer to the 
  same computer. For two emulators on the same computer, use “
  127.0.0.1:port” for both master and slave. 

  The JOYCE Menu

If you press [f9] (or the Menu key on a Windows95 keyboard, or 
Command+F9 on a Mac OS X system) a menu will appear at the top of 
the screen. It offers the following options:

  ESC=Back to JOYCE

Leaves the menu system.

  f1 = Help

Display the keyboard layout onscreen.

  f2 = Discs

Options for floppy drives A: and B:. Use this to "insert" and 
"eject" discs, and to read floppy discs into the JOYCE 
environment. It brings up the Discs menu below.

  f4 = Printer

Control the built-in dot-matrix or daisywheel printer. You should 
not normally need to use this menu; the “printer control” state 
(obtained by pressing [*] on the numeric keypad or [PrintScreen]) 
should be able to perform the necessary functions.

  f5 = Reboot

Reboot the PCW; equivalent to SHIFT+EXTRA+EXIT. You will be asked 
for confirmation.

  f6 = Settings

Settings for all aspects of the emulator. The Settings menu will 
appear.

  f7 = Dbg

Display the Debug menu ([sec: dbgmenu]). 

  f8 = Action

Display the Action menu ([sub:The-Action-Menu]).

  f10 = Quit

Leave JOYCE. You will be asked for confirmation. Under Mac OS X, 
[f10] is used by Exposé so use Command+F10.

  <sub:The-Action-Menu>The Action Menu

This menu has only one option: “Select PCW screen.” This is 
intended for use with GSX programs (such as DR Graph) which exit 
without shutting GSX down properly. In such cases, the program 
will appear to hang, but selecting the PCW screen will display 
the A> prompt. It can also be used if you run DISCKIT while in 
the 800x600 screen mode; DISCKIT always sends its output to the 
original PCW screen.

  <sec: dbgmenu>The Debug Menu

There are three options here, intended mainly for advanced users 
or JOYCE developers. 

  “CPU state” displays the values of the Z80 registers and the 
  memory paging.

  “Debug mode” displays the debug console, on which system 
  messages will appear[footnote:
In previous versions, JOYCE had a built-in debugger that ran in 
the debug console. This is not present in JOYCE v1.9.0.
].

  “RAM dump” writes out the bottom 256k of memory to a file in 
  the current directory called “joyce.ram”. This is not a full 
  snapshot facility; memory dumps can't be reloaded, and they 
  don't contain CPU state.

  The Disks menu

The Disks menu displays the status of the floppy drives, and 
allows you to eject or insert discs. Each drive has three lines 
in the menu:

  The first line reads either “Drive A: (Ejected)” or “Drive A: 
  (Filename)”. This shows whether there is a “disc” (.DSK file) 
  in the drive or not.

  The second line reads either “Eject” or “Insert...” depending 
  whether there's a disc in the drive. “Eject” ejects the current 
  disc (.DSK file); while “Insert...” brings up a window asking 
  for the file to insert. You can also “insert” a real floppy 
  drive; this allows the emulated PCW to access a real drive 
  directly (if slowly). If you ask to “insert” a folder, and the 
  folder you select has not previously been used in this way by 
  JOYCE, then you will be asked what format the folder should 
  pretend to be in.

  The bottom line for each drive reads “Read only”. If there is a 
  tick beside it then the write protect holes on the disc have 
  been opened and it cannot be written to.

  If you select“Disc management...” then a menu appears allowing 
  you to read in extra floppy discs, or convert .DSK files back 
  to real discs.

  The Disc Management menu

There are five options:

  Add a boot disc - Reads in a start-of-day disc and adds it to 
  the opening menu.

  Rename a boot disc - Allows you to change the caption 
  associated with a start-of-day disc.

  Delete a boot disc - Removes a start-of-day disc from the 
  opening menu. Use this option with caution!

  Convert floppy to JOYCE .DSK file - Read in a normal (data) 
  disc, storing the new disc image file in the “user discs” 
  directory.

  Write .DSK file back out to floppy - Convert a disc image file 
  (either normal or start-of-day) back to a floppy disc.

  The Settings menu

Choose the item of hardware for which you want to make changes. 
Note that if you make a change such as disconnecting or 
connecting an interface, the emulated PCW may not pick it up 
until the next reboot. It's safest to change JOYCE settings while 
the opening menu is on the screen - after all, you wouldn't plug 
an interface into a real PCW with the power on, would you?

  <sec: genopt>General options

This screen allows you to choose which PCW model to emulate, and 
how fast it should appear to be. Some points to note are:

  JOYCE knows the difference between boot discs for dot-matrix 
  PCWs (8256, 8512, 9256, 10) and daisywheel PCWs (9512, 9512+). 
  If you have selected a PCW model that doesn't match the boot 
  disc, JOYCE selects the closest equivalent when booting.

  JOYCE treats the PCW8256 and PCW8512 as one choice, since the 
  only difference is the number of disc drives and the memory 
  size, both of which can be configured in other menus.

  JOYCE also treats the PCW9256 and the PCW10 as one choice. The 
  differences between these models are the memory size and the 
  presence of a Centronics port, both of which are configurable 
  in other menus.

This screen also allows you to control the warning that appears 
when a CP/M program attempts to access files outside the emulator 
(as, for example, the supplied IMPORT and EXPORT utilities do). 
Select “File Access...” and select one of three options:

  Allow full access Programs running under CP/M will be able to 
  read and write any file on your computer, without prompting. 
  This is how JOYCE 2.2.6 and previous versions behaved.

  Prompt for each file When a CP/M program attempts to read or 
  write a file, JOYCE will display a prompt asking whether this 
  should be allowed (see below).

  No file access CP/M programs will not be able to access 
  arbitrary files on your computer. The IMPORT and EXPORT 
  utilities will not operate.

If 'Prompt for each file' is selected, then when a CP/M program 
attempts to open a file, the following warning will be displayed:

Confirm host file access



A CP/M program is attempting to access the file:

bank_passwords.txt

Do you want to allow access to this file?



No

No, and don't ask again

Yes

The prompt will offer three options:

  No Access to the file will be blocked. You will be prompted 
  again if the program attempts to read or write a different 
  file.

  No, and don't ask again Access to the file will be blocked, and 
  the File Access settings screen will be switched to the “No 
  file access” option, blocking all future file access. If you 
  subsequently want to grant access again, this must be done 
  through the File Access menu screen.

  Yes Access to this file will be allowed. You will be prompted 
  again if the program attempts to read or write a different 
  file.

  Memory

This allows you to set the memory size of your emulated PCW. If 
your computer is running very low on memory, the “Current memory 
size” may be less than requested. 

If you are running a very old version of CP/M, you may need to 
reduce memory to 512k to get DISCKIT to run. Some LocoScript 1 
versions also malfunction if there's more than 512k of memory.

  Disc drives

Note: The menus in this section only allows you to create 
configurations that could exist on a real PCW. By manually 
editing ~/Joyce/joycehw.xml, you can create “impossible” 
configurations, such as a system with three floppy drives (CP/M 
and LocoScript won't detect the third one.) If the configuration 
is “impossible”, the menus will look different as they attempt to 
accommodate the changes.

The settings in this menu are:

  Boot discs are read-write / read-only: 

This sets whether JOYCE makes emulated boot discs 
write-protected. Note that early CP/M releases (such as the 1.4 
BIOS issued with 8000 series PCWs) need to have a change made to 
SUBMIT.COM[footnote:
Here's a transcript of a SID session making the necessary change:

A>SID SUBMIT.COM

CP/M 3 SID - Version 3.0

] before they can boot from write-protected disc images.

To override this for a particular boot disc, press [f9] while the 
loading stripes are on the screen; then press [f2] and change the 
setting.

  Controller type (8256/8512/9512 vs. 9256/9512+/10) 

You should set the correct controller type to match your system 
discs. At least some versions of Locoscript 3 for the PCW9256 
refuse to load unless the controller type is also set to 9256. 
This option is also set by the “PCW model” setting in the general 
options screen.

  Drive A: settings / Drive B: settings: 

This brings up its own menu, allowing you to set what type of 
disc drive is attached to the PCW. The three standard types are 
those supplied as standard with PCWs. If you want to emulate 5.25”
 drives or anything else unusual, select “other” and manually 
enter the drive type, the number of cylinders[footnote:
The drive documentation may call this figure the number of tracks 
rather than the number of cylinders. Either way, it's usually 40 
or 80.
] it can access, and whether it's single or double-sided.

To emulate a single-drive PCW, set the type of drive B: to “Not 
connected”.

  <sec: extradrv>Extra drives

This menu allows you to set up drives C: - L: and N: - P:. 
Obviously these drives don't exist on real PCWs, but they can on 
a JOYCE system, provided you are using a recent version of CP/M 
(1.12 / 2.12 or later) or LocoScript (2.50 or later). You will 
need to have a copy of JOYCEDRV.FID on your start-of-day disc for 
these drives to become available - see section [sec: joycedrv].

For each drive, you can set it up in three ways:

  As direct access to the PC's floppy drives. 

  As a floppy drive that accesses a standard disc image file, 
  just like the emulated A: and B: drives.

  As a hard drive with 8Mb of storage. The hard drive will also 
  be stored on a .DSK file (or in a folder, depending which 
  option you chose), but this .DSK file will not be usable in 
  emulated floppy drives.

To set up a drive, choose it from the list. Then choose or enter 
the filename and drive type, as listed below:






+---------------------------------------------------+----------------------+---------------+
|               Type of drive to use                |     Choose file      | Choose option |
+---------------------------------------------------+----------------------+---------------+
+---------------------------------------------------+----------------------+---------------+
|              Floppy drive A: or B:                |      A: or B:        | floppy drive  |
+---------------------------------------------------+----------------------+---------------+
| Floppy drive using standard image file or folder  | .DSK file or folder  | floppy drive  |
+---------------------------------------------------+----------------------+---------------+
|  Hard drive using special image file or folder    | .DSK file or folder  |  hard drive   |
+---------------------------------------------------+----------------------+---------------+






  Matrix printer

The dot-matrix printer menu offers the following settings:

  Connected/Disconnected: Is the printer plugged in or not? 

  Paper size: There are a number of standard paper sizes; or you 
  can enter your own using “Custom”.

  Output format: PostScript or PNG. PNG output produces a small 
  graphic file (around 20k) per page, while PostScript output 
  produces one vast file (we're talking 6Mb per page) containing 
  all the output from a JOYCE session. Note that although the PNG 
  files produced are small in size, they are big in area. Under 
  Windows, there is also a “Use Windows' GDI” option, which sends 
  output to the default Windows printer.

  Output to Directory: PNG output goes to disc files called “
  matrix0.png”, “matrix1.png” etc., while PostScript output goes 
  to “matrix0.ps”, “matrix1.ps”... The directories used are 
  ~/Joyce/Pngs and ~/Joyce/PS respectively.

  Output to UNIX command: Output goes to a Unix pipeline. You can 
  use this to send output to the Unix printing system. It is 
  recommended to use PostScript output for this. Note that 
  printing will usually only start when JOYCE shuts down.

  Daisywheel printer

The daisywheel printer menu offers the following settings:

  Connected/Disconnected: Is the printer plugged in or not? Note 
  that unlike on a real PCW, disconnecting the daisywheel with 
  the computer turned on does not damage the memory chips!

  Output format: Windows only. You can choose between PostScript 
  (each session produces a single .ps file) or “Use Windows' GDI”
  , which sends output to the default Windows printer.

  Paper size: There are a number of standard paper sizes; or you 
  can enter your own using “Custom”.

  Output to Directory: The output is in PostScript format, and is 
  sent to “daisy0.ps”, “daisy1.ps”, etc. in the directory 
  ~/Joyce/PS.

  Output to UNIX command: Output goes to a Unix pipeline. You can 
  use this to send output to the Unix printing system. Note that 
  printing will usually only start when JOYCE shuts down.

  CEN port and PAR port

The following settings are available for the CEN port and the PAR 
port:

  Connected/Disconnected: Is the appropriate interface connected 
  to the PCW?

  Output to file: Output goes to a disc file. When you select 
  this option, you are asked for the filename to send the output 
  to.

  Output to UNIX command: Output goes to a Unix pipeline. You can 
  use this to send output to the Unix printing system (enter “lpr”
   here, with any appropriate options).

  Output to Parallel port : The port is directly mapped to one of 
  the computer's parallel ports (/dev/parport0, /dev/parport1, 
  etc.) This allows the port to act as a LocoLink master when 
  connected to a real PCW.

  Output to socket: Output is sent to another process or 
  computer, over a socket. This allows the port to act as a 
  LocoLink master in conjunction with another instance of JOYCE.

  Under Windows, you also get the option to send data directly to 
  LPT ports. 

  CPS8256

There are three configuration screens available for the CPS8256. 
The first one has the following settings:

  Connected/Disconnected: Is the CPS8256 interface connected to 
  the PCW?

  Parallel port: Brings up the same settings screen as for the 
  standalone CEN port, to configure output.

  Serial port: Displays the filenames used for serial input and 
  output. These can both be set to a device special file (eg: “
  /dev/ttyS0”) for direct access to serial ports. Under Windows 
  COM1: to COM4: can be chosen.

  Joystick

This allows a real joystick on the computer to simulate an add-on 
joystick for the PCW. The first part of the menu is used to 
select what PCW interface is being emulated - Kempston, 
Spectravideo or Cascade. Note that the Spectravideo and Cascade 
interfaces conflict with the CPS8256 serial interface; don't try 
to use both at the same time. 

Once you have set the joystick type, select the second option to 
choose which joystick on the host system should be connected to 
the emulated interface.

  Keyboard

The keyboard settings screen has five options. The first two are 
related to swapping keys: One controls which way round the CTRL 
and ALT keys are mapped (see section [sec: keyswap]) and the 
other controls which way round the DELETE keys are (see section [sec: keyswap2]
).

The next three keyboard options relate to the option links. PCW 
keyboards have three option links, and by default none of these 
links are connected. To my knowledge no PCW software uses the 
links, but for completeness JOYCE allows you to connect them 
here. The only one with a noticeable effect is LK2; if it's 
connected, pressing the Shift key will not cancel Shift Lock. For 
details of what LK1 and LK3 do, see the PCW hardware guide.

There are also two joystick options. These relate to a curious 
little piece of history. The controllers in all PCW keyboards 
include joystick support; but there's no joystick socket for them 
to plug in to (compare the PC1512 keyboard, where there is a 
joystick socket). Strictly in the interests of completeness, 
JOYCE provides the joystick sockets. To activate one or the 
other, select “Joystick 1” or “Joystick 2”. A menu appears 
listing the joysticks on the host computer; select the one to 
use. To the best of my knowledge no PCW software supports the 
keyboard joystick; use one of the other joystick models to to get 
something useful done.

  Mouse / Lightpen

Two pointing device settings are available here:

  Emulation mode: No mouse, AMX mouse, Kempston mouse or Electric 
  Studio lightpen (see section [sec: mousetypes]).

  Auto patch on or off (see section [sec: autopatch]).

  Video

The Video settings allow you to change:

  “Video refresh” - the number of times per second that the 
  screen is redrawn. You can go up to 50Hz (ie, the screen is 
  redrawn 50 times a second) or down to 0.01Hz (the screen is 
  drawn once every 10 seconds). The default setting in JOYCE is 
  12Hz, which is fine for nearly all programs; even at 3.75Hz 
  CP/M and LocoScript work fine.

  The beeper is usually emulated using the PC's sound card. You 
  can also have it manifest as a red flash of the screen (“Visual 
  Beeper”) or silence (“Disable beeper”).

  You can also choose whether to have a green screen (8000 
  series), white screen (9000 series) or any other screen colours 
  here.

  LocoLink

The LocoLink settings allow you to set whether or not a LocoLink 
interface is connected. If it is, then you get the same options 
as for a parallel port. However, only “Output to Parallel port” 
and “Output to socket” can be used for a LocoLink connection.

  Use “Output to Parallel port” to act as the LocoLink slave when 
  the “master” computer is a real PC. Connect the parallel ports 
  together with a LapLink cable.

  Use “Output to socket” to act as the LocoLink slave when the “
  master” is an emulated computer. 

  Save settings

If you do not save the settings, they will remain in force only 
for the duration of your current JOYCE session. The settings will 
be saved to the file Joyce/joycehw.xml in your home directory.

  JOYCE Utilites

The following utility programs are supplied with JOYCE. They are 
designed to access features of the emulator which have no 
equivalent on a real PCW. You will find them on the disc image “
utils.dsk”.

  CENPORT

CENPORT is a fast driver for the standalone Centronics printer 
port. Just type:

CENPORT

and printer output will be sent to the destination defined for 
that port. Any DEVICE setting for the printer will be ignored.

CENPORT only works under CP/M. LocoScript 1 cannot print from 
JOYCE (except using the emulated dot-matrix printer). If 
LocoScript 2 and later do not detect the Centronics port, use the 
CPS8256 printer port instead. 

  DDJOYCE.PRL

DDJOYCE is a GSX driver for the host PC's graphics screen, 
allowing high-resolution colour graphics to be used from CP/M. It 
requires JOYCE 2.1.7 or later.

To use it, edit your ASSIGN.SYS file. Remove the entry which 
reads

01 @:DDSCREEN

and replace it by

01 @:DDJOYCE

DDJOYCE has been tested with the Digital Research programs DR 
Draw and DR Graph, with the following issues:

  DR Graph works correctly, but when it shuts down the screen 
  goes blank. This is because DR Graph does not make a proper 
  'close workstation' call when it closes. Use the Action menu 
  (section [sub:The-Action-Menu]) to switch back to the PCW 
  screen.

  DR Draw works correctly, though text rendering is rather ugly.

  DOSDIR

DOSDIR displays the contents of a directory in the host 
filesystem (the name DOSDIR is for compatibility with MYZ80). 
Syntax is:

     DOSDIR

  or DOSDIR {x:/path/}filespec

Note that if you include a path you must include a filename. The 
command

     DOSDIR C:/IMAGES/       is invalid, but

     DOSDIR C:/IMAGES/*.*    is valid.

To get lower-case commands, use:

     A>DOSDIR \

     DOSDIR>/usr/local/bin/* 

  EMULIOS.RSX

EMULIOS allows Digital Research Logo to use the 800x600 screen. 
This was buggy in JOYCE 2.0.0-2.1.6, but has now been corrected.



To set it up, use the following commands (under CP/M):

PIP EMULOGO.COM=LOGO.COM

GENCOM EMULOGO

GENCOM EMULOGO EMULIOS

- Then EMULOGO.COM will behave as LOGO.COM, but using the 800x600 
screen.

The following commands will behave differently:

  setpc Allows a number from 0 to 255

  setbg Allows a number from 0 to 255

  savepic The .PIC file saved is in Windows BMP format, and can 
  be exported, renamed to .BMP, and loaded by paint programs.

  loadpic The .PIC file loaded must be in Windows BMP format and 
  have 256 colours, but its size does not have to be 800x600.

  EXPORT

EXPORT will write CP/M files out as UNIX files. It respects exact 
file sizes.

The syntax is:

     EXPORT cpmfile                    { [O] }

     EXPORT unixfile=du:cpmfile        { [O] }

The first form of the command produce a UNIX file with the same 
name as the CP/M file. 

The second form creates a UNIX file with a name that may be 
different from the CP/M name.

Beware: because the CP/M CCP renders all filenames into 
uppercase, it's very unlikely you'll be able to pass directory 
names to EXPORT; if you say

     EXPORT /home/fred/cpmfile

EXPORT.COM will see "/HOME/FRED/CPMFILE", which probably won't 
exist. To get

round this, use:

     A>EXPORT \

     EXPORT>/home/fred/cpmfile

  IMPORT

IMPORT will read UNIX files into the CP/M filesystem. It sets 
exact file sizes.

The syntax is:

     IMPORT {/path/}hostfile            { [O] }

     IMPORT du:=/path/hostfile          { [O] }

     IMPORT du:cpmfile=x:/path/hostfile { [O] }

The first form imports the named file (or files) to the current 
drive and user area.

The second form imports the file (or files) to the specified 
drive and user area, keeping the original name(s).

The third form imports the files, changing their name(s) to match 
the provided CP/M filename(s).

If the [O] option is present, existing CP/M files with the same 
name as an imported file will be overwritten without asking. 
Otherwise you are asked for confirmation.

Both filenames may include wildcards, and the second and third 
forms can include CP/M driveletters and user numbers:

     A:IMPORT \

     IMPORT>2F:*.ASC=/usr/doc/*.txt

will import all the .txt files in /usr/doc to drive F, group 2.

Filenames are expanded case-sensitively, so you will normally 
need to use the backslash, as above, to get lower-case letters 
into the command line.

  <sec: joycedrv>JOYCEDRV

JOYCEDRV.FID is a file which is used to add one or more extra 
disc drives to CP/M (v1.12/2.12+) or LocoScript (v2.30+) running 
within JOYCE. The first of these drives will usually be drive C:.

Unless the settings are changed (see section [sec: extradrv]) the 
drives will be set up as 8Mb hard drives, called 
~/Joyce/Disks/c.dsk, ~/Joyce/Disks/d.dsk, etc.

How many drives you get depends on your environment, but on my 
system I get five under CP/M (C:,D:,E:,F:,and G:), and thirteen 
under LocoScript (C: to L: and N: to P:).

To enable JOYCEDRV, copy the file JOYCEDRV.FID to your 
start-of-day disc image. For example:

  Start JOYCE.

  Select CP/M from the boot menu.

  When the A> prompt appears, press [f9], then [f2] (Disc), then 
  choose the “Insert” option for drive B:. Click on “disc file”.

  In the file chooser that appears, click “System disc files”, 
  then “utils.dsk”. Then click OK.

  Back in the f2=Disc menu, choose “EXIT”. Then press ESC to 
  leave the menu system.

  Back at the CP/M prompt, type PIP A:=B:JOYCEDRV.FID

  Press [f9], then [f5] to reboot, and confirm this.

  Select CP/M from the boot menu.

  JOYCEDRV should now list available drives. If not, then your 
  version of CP/M is too old.

If you try to use a disc image that JOYCEDRV cannot understand, 
you will not be able to access it. Under CP/M, you will get an 
"invalid drive" error; under LocoScript, you will get a "FID 
error".

  PCKEY

Syntax: 

PCKEY keyfile

or: 

PCKEY keyfile fidfile

PCKEY is used to alter the mapping of PC keys to PCW keys. You 
may need to use this utility if your keyboard does not have a UK 
layout, or you are using a laptop where some keys are difficult 
to get at. This was buggy in JOYCE 2.0.0-2.1.9, but has now been 
corrected.

When PCKEY is given one parameter, it will read the keyfile and 
make the changes immediately. When it is given two, it will 
compile the keyfile into a .FID file, which can then be put on a 
start-of-day disc and which will make the necessary assignments 
every time JOYCE is started.

The format of the keyfile is a series of lines; each line reads:

pc-number  modifier  pcw-number  {comment}

  pc-number is the number of the key. For a full listing, see 
  Appendix [keycodes].

  NOTE: These numbers changed between SDL 0.8 and SDL 0.10; so if 
  you are upgrading JOYCE from a version which used SDL 0.8, you 
  need to rewrite your PCKEY files.

  modifier must be N, for compatibility with the old DOS version 
  of JOYCE.

  pcw-number is the PCW key number. These are listed in the PCW 
  manual.

So, a typical line might read:

 

27 N 8  ESC goes to EXIT

 

  Notes:

  The key mapping you have set remains until you exit JOYCE.

  The option in the Settings menu to swap CTRL/ALT and 
  Backspace/Delete uses the same method as PCKEY. It is probably 
  best not to map these four keys.

  Key 256 brings up the JOYCE menu. Key 257 brings up the Exit 
  Confirmation screen.

  If you use VGACOM to switch into VGA mode, note that keys set 
  up by PCKEY don't affect the keyboard in VGA mode.

  QUIT

Syntax: 

QUIT { number } { [O] }

QUIT will exit JOYCE. With no parameters, it will check whether 
there are files on drive M: which may need saving, and if there 
are it will ask for confirmation.

The number parameter is the error level which JOYCE should 
return. If there is no number parameter, JOYCE returns 98.

The [O] option disables the M: drive check and quits immediately.

  REDIR

REDIR allows you to use one or more PC directories as drives 
under CP/M. See the separate file REDIR.DOC for more information.

  RTC

  Syntax: 

RTC 

or 

RTC [C]

RTC reads the PC's built-in clock. It can be used in two ways.

  RTC by itself will set the PCW's clock from the PC's clock. The 
  timing of the PCW's clock will then depend on the speed of 
  emulation, which is another way of saying that it will 
  gradually diverge from the PC's clock.

  RTC [C] links the PCW's clock to the PC's clock; it will be set 
  to the correct time whenever CP/M reads it.

  VGA and VGACOM

VGA.FID allows CP/M programs to make direct use of the PC screen 
and keyboard. This gives more text on the screen and faster 
output.

Once VGA.FID has loaded, type VGACOM ON to activate it, and 
VGACOM OFF to deactivate it.

Your PCW screen will now be 100 columns x 36 lines. Nearly all 
the normal PCW escape codes are supported, which should enable 
character-based programs to be run. Since screen output is now 
being done by the host PC's processor, you should notice an 
improvement in speed.

If you run DISCKIT or a graphical program like Stop Press, you 
will find that no output is visible; use the Action menu (section 
[sub:The-Action-Menu]) to switch back to the native PCW screen. 

The following escape codes work differently in the 800x600 VGA 
mode:

  ESC b / ESC c set colours (so the numbers in the PALETTE 
  command actually have meaning).

  ESC y sets 32x90 mode.

  ESC z sets 36x100 mode.

  XPALETTE

Syntax: 

XPALETTE b f

or: 

XPALETTE br bg bb fr fg fb

XPALETTE takes advantage of the colours on a VGA screen to allow 
the PCW to display in any colour scheme, not just black and 
white. 

The version with two parameters works the same way as on a CPC or 
a Spectrum +3 (though neither of these has as many colours as 
JOYCE has). For example, on a CPC you might type:

PALETTE 2 63

to get white text on a blue background. So, in JOYCE, type

XPALETTE 2 63

and the screen colours obediently change.

The version with six parameters allows any colour in the 24-bit 
range to be selected, rather than just 64. Instead of a colour 
being represented by one number, it is represented by three:

XPALETTE 0 0 32 255 255 251

will give you a very dark blue background and a foreground with 
the slightest tinge of yellow.

XPALETTE does not mind how the numbers are separated (with 
commas, spaces, *s or whatever) and accepts Hex numbers preceded 
with & (128 = &80 etc.).

Note! Unlike PALETTE 0 0, XPALETTE 0 0 really does select black 
on black. This is not recommended.

  JOYCE utilities (PC hosted)

If you don't want to use JOYCE's own methods for converting 
between disc files and image files, you can also use the dsktrans 
program, which is installed with JOYCE.

The command to use is either:

dsktrans /dev/fdn dskfile 

    - Floppy disc to image file

or 

dsktrans dskfile /dev/fdn -otype floppy 

    - Image to floppy disc.

DSKTRANS isn't as versatile as CPCTRANS (for example, it can only 
handle discs in recognisable PCW or +3DOS formats) but it doesn't 
need telling what sort of disc it is using, and it is a native 
(not DOS-hosted) program.

To copy a MicroDesign 3 protected disc with DSKTRANS, add “-md3” 
to the end of the command line. 

  <sec: md3nt>MD3 discs and Windows NT / 2000 / XP

Windows NT, 2000 and XP will flat-out refuse to read MicroDesign 
3 program discs, owing to the copy protection used on them. If 
you are using Windows 2000 or XP, then it is possible to install 
Simon Owen's floppy disc driver <http://simonowen.com/fdrawcmd/>. 
In this case, select the “Alternative floppy” option as well as 
choosing “MicroDesign program disc”.

If you are using Windows NT, or if you don't have the correct 
driver installed, there is no way to make JOYCE capable of 
reading MD3 discs. You will need to:

  Create a bootable DOS floppy disc. If you're on a system which 
  can't do this, then you may be able to get hold of one at 
  www.bootdisk.com. If you only have one floppy drive, the boot 
  disc needs to include a RAM drive at least 1Mb in size. 

  Copy MD3TRANS.EXE to the DOS disc.

  Boot from the DOS disc.

  If you have two drives: Insert the MD3 disc in drive B: and 
  type

MD3TRANS B: A:dskfile

  If you have one drive: Copy MD3TRANS to the RAM drive

COPY MD3TRANS.EXE C:

  then insert your MD3 disc and run MD3TRANS

C:MD3TRANS A: C:dskfile

then insert your boot disc and copy the resulting file back.

COPY C:dskfile A:

Either way, MD3TRANS will produce some error messages when 
copying the protected track. Answer 'I'gnore to any error 
messages that might appear. 

  <failread>Problems reading floppies on Windows 9x

On some versions of Windows 95, 98 or ME, JOYCE has trouble 
creating disc image files. The transfer appears to work, but runs 
very very slowly; and the resulting .DSK file is blank.

To get round this:

  Open a DOS prompt.

  Change to the drive and directory holding JOYCE - eg:

C:\WINDOWS>CD “\Program Files\JOYCE”

C:\Program Files\JOYCE>

  Use a PCWTRANS command to read the discs:

PCWTRANS x: dskfile

  When adding the disks to JOYCE, browse to the .DSK file that 
  was just created rather than choosing a real drive.

  <sec: admins>For Unix system administrators

First and foremost, don't run JOYCE as the root user! JOYCE gives 
the PCW programs within it various methods to access the host 
filesystem; it is entirely possible that a malicious PCW program 
running within JOYCE could damage important Unix files. 

It is possible to set up a system-wide installation of JOYCE with 
default settings, boot discs and other discs. To do this, first 
set up the desired configuration as a normal user. Then copy the 
following files:

  From ~user/Joyce to /usr/local/share/Joyce: joycehw.xml

  From ~user/Joyce/Boot to /usr/local/share/Joyce/Boot: boot*.dsk 
  and joycebt.xml

  From ~user/Joyce/Disks to /usr/local/share/Joyce/Disks: Any 
  other .dsk files that should be common.

This will then become the default configuration on your system. 
Users will still be able to change settings or add additional 
discs; these will be saved to their local configuration 
directories.

  <keycodes>Keyboard codes

Note that many of these keys don't exist in a standard PC 
keyboard. For example, the PC keyboard has no “$” key (it uses 
SHIFT + 4 instead) so assigning codes to that key will have no 
effect.

  Acknowledgements

This version of JOYCE could not have been written without:

  Ian Collier, who wrote the "xz80" emulator. The Z80 emulator in 
  JOYCE is based on the one in xz80.

  Richard Clayton, who supplied vital information on the 
  interactions between the XBIOS and the hardware.

  Cliff Lawson, who made the PCW hardware specification public.

  Richard Fairhurst and Jacob Nevins, who provided hardware 
  information.

  The many authors of Linux, GNU, gcc, SDL, libpng and libxml.

  The MICO authors who created the mini-STL.

  Frank D. Cringle, who wrote the Z80 emulator test suite in 
  YAZE.

  David Cantrell, for his posting on comp.sys.amstrad.8bit 
  describing the use of PostScript in printer emulation.

  Matthew Gomez, who suggested some of the colour names in the 
  custom colour menu.

  Digital Research, the original authors of CP/M, GEM and GSX.

  Caldera (as was; it later ended up as Lineo), for releasing GEM 
  under the GPL.

  Everyone who over the years has spared the time to contact me 
  about JOYCE, in particular those who found incompatibilities in 
  the emulation.

  Previous versions also owed much to:

  Marat Fayzullin, who wrote the original Z80 emulation code. 
  However, none of this code now remains in JOYCE, because it is 
  not compatible with the GPL.

  Ian Macdonald, who tested JOYCE for DOS.

  The authors of DJGPP, GRX20 and DRDOS.

  Samuel Vincent, the author of the SVAsync library.

  Martynas Kunigelis, on whose DJGPP keyboard driver I based that 
  of JOYCE for DOS.
