	* General: Moved all .TAP manipulation into tapeio.c / tapeio.h.
	* General: Added support for .TZX and .PZX files. Any program that
		  outputs a tape file now takes -f options to specify the
		  output format.
	* tapcat:  New options allow a raw binary file to be treated as any
		  kind of Spectrum file.
	* mkmgtfs: New program created: behaves as mkp3fs, but with	
		  MGT disk format rather than Spectrum +3.
	* mkibmtap: New program created: behaves as tapcat, but with
	 	  IBM 5150 tape format rather than Spectrum.

2010-05-03 John Elliott

	* taptools-1.0.7 released.

	* dsk2tap: Tweaked the BASIC loader so that if it runs to completion,
	 the program stops with 9 STOP rather than whatever error the +3DOS
	 loader came up with.

2010-04-17 John Elliott

	* taptools-1.0.6 released.

	* dsk2tap: Naively converts an unprotected .DSK to a .TAP file which,
	 when run, formats a floppy and creates a copy of the original disc.

	 tape file.

	* tap2dsk, mkp3fs: New utilities created to construct +3 disc images
	 from scratch.

2007-06-07 John Elliott

	* tapsplit: It seems that on or about 2005-07-11, one Javier Herrera
	 released a modified version of tapsplit but breached the GPL by not
	 distributing source (see
	 <1121094019.524192.7650@g43g2000cwa.googlegroups.com> ).
	 Created tapsplit-1.0.1, which should be a suitable substitute and 
	 can be distributed without fear of my armies of undead lawyers.

	tapcat, tapget, tapls and tapsplit.
