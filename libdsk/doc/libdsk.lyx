What's new? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Important note: 
\series default
If you have coded against a version of LibDsk prior to 1.5.3, bear in mind
 that 1.5.3 is a substantial rewrite.
 The API for your programs remains the same, but there are differences in
 implementation that may trip you up.
 In particular, if you are writing to a disc image file it is very important
 to check the result of dsk_close() -- there are a lot of drivers which
 make their changes in memory and don't try to commit them until dsk_close()
 is called.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For full details, see the file ChangeLog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When converting to Teledisk TD0 format, attempt to come up with a plausible
 value for the drive type (3.5
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 / 5.25
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The geometry probe has been amended to try and get the correct data rate
 on disc images that don't include this information as metadata.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 'dsk' / 'edsk' driver has been rewritten to support the extensions described
 at <http://simonowen.com/misc/extextdsk.txt>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The LDBS file format has been changed to support the above extensions.
 LDBS files created by LibDsk 1.5.3 and earlier can still be used, but don't
 support the extensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Added a new 'qrst' driver for Compaq QRST-format disc images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Various bugfixes in the IMD driver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Added a new 'ldbs' driver for LDBS-format disc images.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CopyQM and Teledisk are no longer supported in 16-bit Windows builds, because
 16-bit Windows does not provide the sscanf() function to DLLs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Added a new 'complement' option to the drive geometry, allowing for disc
 image formats where the bytes are stored complemented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Added a new 'jv3' driver for JV3-format disc images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A bugfix to the automatic geometry probe in the 'imd' driver: HD discs were

Added a new 'imd' driver for IMD-format disc images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A new SIDES_EXTSURFACE geometry, for disc images where the sector numbers
 on side 1 follow on from side 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TeleDisk images with 'advanced' (LZH) compression are now supported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Added a new 'ydsk' driver for YAZE ydsk-format disc images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some disc image files include filesystem information as part of the disc
 image metadata.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Should now compile out of the box on FreeBSD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A bugfix to the rcpmfs driver should allow it to simulate a CP/M 2 filesystem

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Terms and definitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this document, I use the word 
\noun on
cylinder
\noun toggle
 to refer to a position on a floppy disc, and 
\noun on
track
\noun toggle
 to refer to the data within a cylinder on one side of the disc.
 For a single-sided disc, these are the same; for a double-sided disc, there
 are twice as many tracks as cylinders.

, but the tracks are stored in a different order.
 LibDsk also applies a sector skew so that the sectors are read/written
 in the logical order.
 Strictly speaking, it should not do this (when libdsk is used with cpmtools,
 cpmtools is the one that does the skewing) but cpmtools cannot handle the
 skewing scheme used by the Microbee format.

\begin_layout Section
Architecture 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LibDsk is composed of a fixed core (files named 
\family typewriter
dsk*.c
\family default
) and a number of drivers (files named 
\family typewriter
drv*.c
\family default
).
 When you open an image or a drive (using 
\family typewriter
dsk_open()
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
dsk_creat()
\family default
 ) then a driver is chosen.
 This driver is then used until it's closed (
\family typewriter
dsk_close()
\family default
).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each driver is identified by a name.
 To get a list of available drivers, use 
\family typewriter
dsk_type_enum()
\family default
.
 To get the driver that is being used by an open DSK image, use 
\family typewriter
dsk_drvname()
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
dsk_drvdesc()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Logical and physical sectors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LibDsk has two models of disc geometry.
 One is as a linear array of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

logical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sectors - for example, a 720k floppy appears as 1440 512-byte sectors numbered
 0 to 1439.
 The other locates each sector using a (Cylinder, Head, Sector) triple -
 so on the 720k floppy described earlier, sectors would run from (0,0,1)
 to (79,1,9).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Internally, all LibDsk drivers are written to use the Cylinder/Head/Sector
 model.
 For those calls which take parameters in logical sectors, LibDsk uses the
 information in a 
\family typewriter
DSK_GEOMETRY
\family default
 structure to convert to C/H/S.
 
\family typewriter
DSK_GEOMETRY
\family default
 also contains information such as the sector size and data rate used to
 access a given disc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those functions which deal with whole tracks (such as the command to format
 a track) use logical tracks and (cylinder,head) pairs instead.
 To initialise a 
\family typewriter
DSK_GEOMETRY
\family default
 structure, either: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
call 
\family typewriter
dsk_getgeom()
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\family typewriter
SIDES_ALT
\family default
 The tracks are ordered Cylinder 0 Head 0; C0H1; C1H0; C1H1; C2H0; C2H1

 This layout is used by most PC-hosted operating systems, including DOS
 and Linux.
 Amstrad's 8-bit operating systems also use this ordering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
SIDES_OUTBACK
\family default
 The tracks go out to the edge on Head 0, and then back in on Head 1 (so
 Cylinder 0 Head 0 is the first track, while Cylinder 0 Head 1 is the last).
 This layout is used by Freek Heite's 144FEAT driver (for CP/M-86 on the
 PC) but I have not seen it elsewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
SIDES_OUTOUT
\family default
 The tracks go out to the edge on Head 0, then out again on Head 1 (so the
 order goes C(last)H0, C0H1, C1H1, ..., C(last)H1).
 This ordering is used by Acorn-format discs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

SIDES_EXTSURFACE
\family default
 The tracks are arranged in the same way as SIDES_ALT, but if the sectors
 on side 0 are numbered 1-

\begin_layout Standard
These function calls behave as 
\family typewriter

\begin_layout Standard
These functions are intended to read all the sector IDs from a track, in

\begin_layout Standard
dsk_xread() and dsk_xwrite() are extended versions of dsk_pread() and dsk_pwrite

 They allow the caller to read/write sectors whose sector ID differs from
 the physical location of the sector, or to read/write deleted data..

\end_inset

cylinder
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 are the values to search for in the sector header.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These functions are only supported by the CPCEMU driver, the Linux floppy
 driver and the NTWDM floppy driver.
 Other drivers will return DSK_ERR_NOTIMPL.
 Unless you are emulating a floppy controller, or you need to read discs
 that contain deleted data or misnumbered sectors, it should not be necessary
 to call these functions.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

deleted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 argument is used if you want to read or write sectors that have been marked
 as deleted.
 In 
\family typewriter
dsk_xwrite()
\family default
, this is a simple value; pass 0 to write normal data, or 1 to write deleted
 data.
 In 
\family typewriter
dsk_xread()
\family default
, pass the address of an integer containing 0 (read normal data) or 1 (read
 deleted data).
 On return, the integer will contain: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the requested data type was read: 0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the other data type was read: 1 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the command failed: Value is meaningless.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Passing 
\family typewriter
NULL
\family default
 acts the same as passing a pointer to 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The opposite type of data will only be read if you set 
\family typewriter

 as the option name).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forces the driver to ignore the head number passed to it and always use

 This is used to read discs recorded on PCW / CPC / Spectrum+3 add-on 3.5"

 Instead of the system software being programmed to use both sides of the
 disc, a switch on the drive was used to set which side was being used.
 Thus discs would end up with both sides saying they were head 0.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
REMOTE:TESTING This disables an optimisation in the remote driver, so that

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Filesystem driver options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible that as part of its geometry probe, LibDsk will have detected
 a CP/M or DOS filesystem on a disc image.
 Alternatively, a disc image may contain filesystem metadata (for example,
 the YAZE ydsk and RCPMFS drivers both contain CP/M filesystem parameters).
 These parameters appear as driver options, prefixed with the name FS:.
 When making a copy, dsktrans enumerates the driver options on the source
 disc image and sets them to the same values on the destination image.
 This is necessary to ensure that (for example) when one YDSK is copied
 to another, its filesystem parameters are transferred.
 The current filesystem options supported by LibDsk are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
FS:CP/M:BSH Block shift - 3 => 1k, 4 => 2k, 5 => 4k...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

 0x8000 for a fixed disc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
FS:CP/M:VERSION Filesystem version (-2 (ISX), 2 (CP/M 2) or 3 (CP/M 3).
 This is only supported by the 'rcpmfs' driver.)
\end_layout

Reverse CP/M-FS (rcpmfs) backend
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rcpmfs backend is designed to present a host directory as a read/write
 CP/M disk image.
 This has a number of uses:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You could construct a CP/M disk image using dsktrans 
\emph on
directory filename
\emph default
 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Conversely, you could extract the files from a CP/M disk image using dsktrans
 
\emph on
filename directory
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is possible for a CP/M emulator running a genuine copy of CP/M to use
 LibDsk to access files on the host system, without altering the BDOS or
 installing additional drivers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
rcpmfs does not work with systems that only support 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

8.3
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 format filenames; it also needs a system call that can set the size of
 a file (such as truncate() under 
\noun on
Unix
\noun default
).
 It therefore remains unimplemented in the DOS and Win16 versions of the
 library.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
In Use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use an rcpmfs directory in LibDsk, pass a directory name instead of a
 filename.
 Files in the directory which match CP/M naming conventions (8.3 filenames)
 will appear in the emulated disk image; if there are more files than will
 fit in the emulated disk, LibDsk will stop when it reaches one that doesn't
 fit.
 Under Windows, the 'short filename' is used, so files with names not matching
 CP/M conventions may also be mapped with names like README~1.HTM.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CP/M has 16 user areas (some variants support 32; rcpmfs does not), and
 files with the same name can exist in each area.
 rcpmfs represents nonzero user areas by prepending 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nn..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the filename; so if a CP/M program created a file called EXAMPLE.DAT
 in user 4, this would be saved as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

04..example.dat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the underlying directory.
 The double dot ensures that the resulting filename is not a valid CP/M
 name, and therefore won't conflict with any file in user 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
rcpmfs can behave as a CP/M 2 or CP/M 3 filesystem.
 If the latter, it constructs a disc label (based on the name of the directory)
 and turns on date/time stamping.
 Update and access stamps are used, because they map nicely to the utime()
 system call.
 It can also emulate the filesystem used by the ISX emulator, which stores
 file sizes slightly differently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
rcpmfs initialisation file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a directory to be usable by rcpmfs, it should contain a file called
 .libdsk.ini describing the format to use.
 This file is in INI format, similar to libdskrc (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:libdskrc-format"

\end_inset

).
 It must contain only one section: [RCPMFS].
 Within that section, the following variables may be present:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
BlockSize Size of a CP/M data block.
 Must be a power of 2, and at least 1024.
 If there are more than 255 blocks in the CP/M filesystem, this must be
 at least 2048.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
DirBlocks Number of blocks containing the CP/M directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
TotalBlocks Total number of data and directory blocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SysTracks Number of system tracks.
 These will be stored in a file called .libdsk.boot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Version CP/M version that will be accessing the filesystem.
 This should be 2, 3 or ISX:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description
2 CP/M 2 -- no time stamps or disk labels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
3 CP/M 3 -- time stamps and disk labels are present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
ISX Used by the ISX emulator.
 Similar to CP/M 2, but byte 13 of the CP/M directory entry holds the number
 of 
\emph on
unused
\emph default
 bytes in the last record, not the number of 
\emph on
used
\emph default
 bytes.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
Format Name of one of the LibDsk built-in or user-supplied formats, giving
 the geometry that the simulated disk will have.
 Alternatively, you can specify the format manually, using the same variable
 names as in libdskrc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there is no .libdsk.ini file present, LibDsk will assume BlockSize=1024,
 DirBlocks=2, TotalBlocks=175,SysTracks=1, Version=3, Format=pcw180.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you call dsk_option_set with any of the following options:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

and the value written differs from the one used before, then a new .libdsk.ini
 file will be written with the revised filesystem parameters and the directory
 rescanned.
 This allows a command of the form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsktrans -otype rcpmfs disc-image directory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
to stand a reasonable chance of working as long as the source disc image
 has a CP/M filesystem that LibDsk can detect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, -2);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bugs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
rcpmfs is not without its bugs and missing features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To my knowledge, rcpmfs has only been tested under the dsktrans pattern
 of usage (which writes the directory and then the file space), and with
 fairly simple operations in a CP/M emulator.
 It is not known how well it holds up under heavy use as a live CP/M filesystem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The CP/M attributes F1-F4, passwords and permissions are not mapped.
 The SYS and ARC attributes are only mapped in the Win32 version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Formatting (or reformatting) an rcpmfs directory writes out a new .libdsk.ini
 containing the geometry used to do the format.
 However, since DSK_GEOMETRY doesn't contain the CP/M filesystem parameters
 (block size, block count, etc.) these will be the ones previously used in
 that directory, and quite possibly completely wrong.
 If you want to 'format' the directory using LibDsk, call dsk_set_option()
 with the six 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

FS:CP/M:

 options listed above to set up the correct filesystem parameters.
 Or create the .libdsk.ini by other means.

Windows 3.x
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only the 16-bit build of LibDsk will run.
 The floppy support in Win16 is pretty much the same as in DOS; there is
 support for discs with arbitrary numbers of tracks and sectors, and arbitrary
 sector sizes.
 This means that LibDsk can, for example, read Acorn ADFS floppies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Windows 4.x (95, 98 and ME)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the 16-bit and 32-bit versions of LibDsk will run.
 The 16-bit version is more capable, but less stable; it can read Acorn
 ADFS floppies, which the 32-bit version cannot.
 Unfortunately, 32-bit programs can't link to the 16-bit version of LibDsk

Windows NT (NT 3.x, NT 4.x, 2000, XP) without ntwdm driver
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The floppy drive can only read/write formats which are supported by the
 floppy driver.
 This is the case using either version of LibDsk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Windows 2000 and XP with ntwdm driver
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simon Owen's enhancement to the Windows 2000 floppy driver can be downloaded
 from <http://simonowen.com/fdrawcmd/>.
 Once it is installed, LibDsk (using its 'ntwdm' driver rather than 'floppy')
 has pretty much carte blanche regarding floppy formats, and can access
 discs in many formats including Acorn ADFS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
General comments on programming floppy access for Windows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LibDsk has four independent drivers for accessing floppies under Windows.
 They are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Win16 driver.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This uses INT 0x13 to do the reads and writes, just as in MSDOS.
 Again as in MSDOS, there is a diskette parameter table pointed to by INT
 0x1E.
 This table seems not to be documented, which is perhaps why the Win16 subsystem
 in Windows 2000/XP doesn't implement it.
 You can, fortunately, tell if this is the case; if the first two bytes
 are both 0xC4, then what you have is a Windows 2000 trap rather than a
 diskette parameter table.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Win32c driver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This driver uses VWIN32 services to make INT 0x13-style calls under Windows9x.
 However, there is no VWIN32 call to change the diskette parameter table,
 which is why the Win16 driver can do things the Win32 drivers can't.
 It isn't possible to get round this by thunking to a 16-bit DLL either;
 the INT 0x1E vector is zero for 16-bit DLLs in 32-bit processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Win32 driver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Windows NT gets close (but not close enough) to the UNIX idea that everything
 is a file.
 So while in theory it would be enough to use the normal

 , in practice there are a number of nasty subtleties relating to such things
 as memory alignment and file locking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The ntwdm driver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This driver is a wrapper around fdrawcmd.sys, which allows commands to be
 issued to the floppy controller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Other floppy APIs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sydex produce a replacement floppy driver for 32-bit versions of Windows
 (SydexFDD) which is not supported by LibDsk.

LDSERVER
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LDSERVER is a program that makes the 16-bit LibDsk DLL available to 32-bit
 programs.
 It does this by creating a mailslot (

\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash

\backslash

\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and listening for messages.
 Each message corresponds to a LibDsk call.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 32-bit LibDsk library checks for this mailslot and, if it finds it,
 uses it in preference to its own floppy support.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Compiling LDSERVER
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A compiled version of LDSERVER is not supplied.
 You will need to build it yourself from the files in the rpcserv directory;
 projects are provided for Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5 and Borland C++ 5.0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LDSERVER calls functions in NETAPI.DLL.
 If your compiler doesn't include an import library for this DLL, you will
 have to generate it using the IMPLIB tool - eg:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
IMPLIB NETAPI.LIB NETAPI.DLL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or the equivalent utility for your compiler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Using LDSERVER
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just run LDSERVER.EXE, and then use a 32-bit LibDsk program.
 The server window shows a reference count (0 if it is idle, nonzero if
 LibDsk programs are using it) and the status should change to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Active
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when it is performing disc access.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LDSERVER does not shut down automatically.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Important Security Warning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LDSERVER is a 16-bit program, written using APIs intended for use on a local
 area network.
 These APIs have no security support.
 It will happily obey commands sent from anywhere on your network.
 If your computer is connected to the Internet, it will obey commands sent
 to it over the Internet.
 A malicious attacker could use LDSERVER to overwrite important system files
 or read confidential documents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have a firewall, then make sure that the NetBIOS ports 137, 138 and
 139 are blocked.
 If you don't have a firewall, 
\series bold
\emph on
do not run LDSERVER while your computer is connected to the Internet!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
LibDsk and COM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are building the 32-bit version of LibDsk with Visual C++ 6.0, you
 can also build the accompanying 'atlibdsk' project, which builds a version
 of LibDsk that exports its API through COM.
 This allows relatively easy use of LibDsk from languages that support COM
 binding, such as Visual BASIC or .NET languages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
General points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where LibDsk functions return a dsk_err_t, ATLIBDSK returns a COM HRESULT.
 This will be S_OK for success, a general COM error (such as E_POINTER or
 E_INVALIDARG), or a FACILITY_ITF error (0x8004xxxx).
 The low word of a FACILITY_ITF error is the LibDsk error code, converted
 to a positive number (eg: 0x8004000C is FACILITY_ITF error 12, so the LibDsk
 error is -12, DSK_ERR_SEEKFAIL).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sector buffers to be read/written must be passed as variants containing
 arrays of bytes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The arrays of DSK_FORMAT structures passed to dsk_lform() and dsk_pform()
 are replaced by variants containing arrays of bytes - four bytes per sector
 to format.
 The last byte is the physical sector shift (0 for 128, 1 for 256 etc.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ATLIBDSK exports four object classes:

\begin_layout Section
LibDsk RPC system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LibDsk RPC system is designed to make disc drives on remote computers
 transparently available to LibDsk applications.
 It operates on a client/server basis; LibDsk contains a driver (called
 'remote') that can act as a client, and it can be used to implement a server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The on-the-wire protocol is described in protocol.txt in the documentation
 directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The 'serial' driver
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is designed for using LibDsk over a serial connection - say from a
 3.5
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 computer to a 5.25
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 computer.
 The filename specification to use at the client end is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
serial:
\emph on
port
\emph default
,
\emph on
baud
\emph default
,
\emph on
remotename
\emph default
{,
\emph on
remotetype
\emph default
{,
\emph on
remotecompress
\emph default
}}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
for example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
serial:/dev/ttyS0,9600+crtscts,A:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The various parts of this filename specification are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Under Linux, this is the name of a serial port (eg /dev/ttyS0).

Under Windows, this is likewise the name of a serial port (eg COM1:).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Under DOS, you need to have a FOSSIL serial port driver loaded; LibDsk was
 tested using ADF <http://ftp.iis.com.br/pub/simtelnet/msdos/fossil/adf_150.zip>
 (or do a web search for adf_150.zip).
 The port is then the number assigned by the FOSSIL driver (normally 0).
 Note also that ADF uses a single fixed baud rate, so you should make sure
 that the rate on the command line matches the rate that was used when ADF
 was loaded.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
baud The speed and handshaking options.
 LibDsk does not allow the number of bits, the parity or the count of stop
 bits to be changed; it insists on 8-bit communications with 1 stop bit
 and no parity.
 The speed is a number (300, 600, 1200 etc.) and the handshake option is
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

+crtscts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (to use RTS/CTS handshaking) or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-crtscts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (not to).
 If neither handshake option is present, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

+crtscts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is assumed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
remotename The name of the file or drive on the remote computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
remotetype The type of the file/drive (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dsk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

floppy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 etc.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
remotecompress The compression to use on the remote computer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Servers for the serial driver
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the sample utilities supplied with LibDsk is called serslave (serslave.exe
 under DOS / Windows).
 This is a server using the same serial protocol as above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Launch serslave with the command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
serslave 
\shape italic
port,baud
\shape default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
for example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
serslave COM1:,9600+crtscts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or in DOS (again, a FOSSIL driver is required):
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
serslave 0,19200
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have written a similar server for CP/M systems, called AUXD.
 This is a separate download from the LibDsk web page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The 'fork' driver
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 'fork' driver is used (on any system which supports the fork() system
 call) to send LibDsk requests to a local program using pipes.
 This driver was written for testing purposes, but may come in handy as
 a poor man's plugin system.
 The filename specification is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
fork:
\emph on
program
\emph default
,
\emph on
remotename
\emph default
{,
\emph on
remotetype
\emph default
{,
\emph on
remotecompress
\emph default
}}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
for example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
fork:./dskslave,a.dqk,dsk,sq
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The various parts of this filename specification are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
program The name of the program to use; execlp() is used to launch it, so
 if no path is given the user's PATH will be searched.
 The program must take LibDsk calls from its standard input and send results
 to its standard output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
remotename The name of the file or drive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
remotetype The type of the file/drive (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dsk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

floppy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 etc.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
remotecompress The compression to use.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of a server for this protocol is the example 'forkslave' program;
 this is a very simple wrapper around dsk_rpc_server() which reads RPC packets
 from its standard input and writes them to its standard output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Writing new drivers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interface between LibDsk and its drivers is defined by the DRV_CLASS
 structure.
 To add a new driver, you create a new DRV_CLASS structure and add it to
 various files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two methods of writing a driver.
 One is to provide all the functions yourself.
 The other is to write a driver using LDBS as its internal storage format;
 in that case, you need only provide dc_open(), dc_creat() and dc_close().
 The latter technique is particularly suited to formats that can't be rewritten
 in place (so you have to parse the whole file on open and rewrite the whole
 file on close anyway), and is described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:LDBSdrivers"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming you want to create a full driver that rewrites in-place, proceed
 as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The driver header 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, create a header for this driver, basing it on (for example) 
\family typewriter
lib/drvposix.h
\family default
.
 The first thing in the header (after the LGPL banner) is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
typedef struct 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
{ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    DSK_DRIVER px_super; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    FILE *px_fp; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    int px_readonly;
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    long px_filesize;
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
} POSIX_DSK_DRIVER;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is where you define any variables that your driver needs to store for
 each disc image.
 In the case of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

raw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 driver, this consists of a FILE pointer to access the underlying disc file,
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

readonly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 flag, and the current size of the drive image file.
 The first member of this structure must be of type DSK_DRIVER.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of this header consists of function prototypes, which I will come
 back to later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The driver source file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, create a .c file for your driver.
 Again, it's probably easiest to base this on lib/drvposix.c.
 At the start of this file, create a DRV_CLASS structure, such as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
DRV_CLASS dc_posix = 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
{ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    sizeof(POSIX_DSK_DRIVER), 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    NULL,
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    "raw
\backslash
0rawalt
\backslash
0", 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    "Raw file driver", 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    posix_open, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    posix_creat, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    posix_close 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
}; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first four entries in this structure are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The size of your driver's instance data; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The driver's superclass.
 This should be left as NULL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Possible names for the driver (each will be matched against the name passed
 to 
\family typewriter
dsk_open()
\family default
 / 
\family typewriter
dsk_creat()
\family default
 ).
 Each possible name, including the last, must be followed by 
\backslash
0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The driver's description string.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of the structure is composed of function pointers; the types
 of these are given in drv.h.
 At the very least, you will need to provide the first three pointers (*_open,
 *_creat and *_close); to make the driver vaguely useful, you will also
 need to implement some of the others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have created this structure, edit: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
drivers.h.
 Add a declaration for your DRV_CLASS structure, such as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
extern DRV_CLASS dc_myformat; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
drivers.inc.
 Insert a reference to your structure (eg: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
&dc_myformat,
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) in the list.
 Note that order is important; the comments in drivers.inc describe how to
 decide where things go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edit 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lib/Makefile.am
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Near the top of this file is a list of drivers and their header files;
 just add your .c and .h to this list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your driver depends on certain system headers (as all the floppy drivers
 do) then you will need to add checks for these to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

configure.in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lib/drvi.h
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; then run 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

autoconf
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to rebuild the configure script.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The function pointers in the DRV_CLASS structure are described in drv.h.
 The first parameter to all of them (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) is declared as a pointer to DSK_DRIVER.
 In fact, it is a pointer to the first member of your instance data structure.
 Just cast the pointer to the correct type:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
/* Sanity check: Is this meant for our driver? */ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
if (self->dr_class != &dc_posix) return DSK_ERR_BADPTR; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
pxself = (POSIX_DSK_DRIVER *)self;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and you're in business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Driver functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_open
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_open )(DSK_PDRIVER self, const char *filename)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Attempt to open a disc image.
 Entered with: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 points to the instance data for this disc image (see above); it will have
 been initialised to zeroes using memset().
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

filename
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the name of the image to open.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Return: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
DSK_ERR_OK: The driver has successfully opened the image.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
DSK_ERR_NOTME: The driver cannot handle this image.
 Other drivers should be allowed to try to use it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
other: The driver cannot handle this image.
 No other drivers should be tried (eg: the image was recognised by this
 driver, but is corrupt).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the file has a comment, record it here using dsk_set_comment().
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_creat
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_creat)(DSK_PDRIVER self, const char *filename)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Attempt to create a new disc image.
 For the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

floppy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 drivers, behaves exactly as dc_open.
 Parameters and results are the same as for dc_open, except that DSK_ERR_NOTME
 is treated like any other error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_close
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_close)(DSK_PDRIVER self)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Close the disc image.
 This will be the last call your driver will receive for a given disc image
 file, and it should free any resources it is using.
 Whether it returns DSK_ERR_OK or an error, this disc image will not be
 used again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_read 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_read)(DSK_PDRIVER self, const DSK_GEOMETRY *geom, void *buf,
 dsk_pcyl_t cylinder, dsk_phead_t head, dsk_psect_t sector)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Read a sector.
 Note that sector addresses passed to drivers are 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 in C/H/S format.
 This function has the same parameters and return values as dsk_pread().
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You don't need to check the RECMODE_COMPLEMENT flag in the geometry structure
 (this applies to all read and write functions).
 If the flag is set, the LibDsk core will complement the results from the
 driver before returning them to the caller.
 Similarly, any buffer passed for a write will already be complemented if
 appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_write 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_write)(DSK_PDRIVER self, const DSK_GEOMETRY *geom, const
 void *buf, dsk_pcyl_t cylinder, dsk_phead_t head, dsk_psect_t sector)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Write a sector.
 This function has the same parameters and return values as dsk_pwrite().
 If your driver is read-only, leave this function pointer NULL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_format 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_format)(DSK_PDRIVER self, const DSK_GEOMETRY *geom, dsk_pcyl_t
 cylinder, dsk_phead_t head, const DSK_FORMAT *format, unsigned char filler)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Format a track.
 This function has the same parameters and return values as dsk_pformat().
 If your driver cannot format tracks, leave this function pointer NULL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_getgeom
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_getgeom)(DSK_PDRIVER self, DSK_GEOMETRY *geom)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Get the disc geometry.
 Leave this function pointer as NULL unless either:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Your disc image does not allow a caller to use an arbitrary disc geometry.
 The drivers which currently do this are the Win32 one, because Windows
 NT decides on the geometry itself and doesn't let programs change it; and
 the MYZ80 and SIMH ones, which have a single fixed geometry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Your disc image file contains enough information to populate a DSK_GEOMETRY
 completely.
 The rcpmfs and ydsk drivers do this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You want to do an extended geometry probe including a call to the default
 one.
 The internal function dsk_defgetgeom() has been provided for this; it's
 the same as dsk_getgeom() but always uses the standard probe.
 The LDBS driver does this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Returns DSK_ERR_OK if successful; DSK_ERR_NOTME or DSK_ERR_NOTIMPL to fall
 back to the standard LibDsk geometry probe; other values to indicate failure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_secid 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_secid)(DSK_PDRIVER self, const DSK_GEOMETRY *geom, dsk_pcyl_t
 cylinder, dsk_phead_t head, DSK_FORMAT *result)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Read the ID of the next sector on a certain track/head, and put it in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

result
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Ideally you would simulate a rotating disc, so that the IDs are returned
 in the same order that they were written when the disc was formatted.
 This function is also used to test for discs in CPC format (which have
 oddly-numbered physical sectors); if the disc image can't support this
 (eg: the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

raw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or Win32 drivers) then leave the function pointer NULL.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_xseek 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_xseek)(DSK_PDRIVER self, const DSK_GEOMETRY *geom, dsk_pcyl_t
 cylinder, dsk_phead_t head);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seek to a given cylinder / head.
 For disc images, just return DSK_ERR_OK if the cylinder/head are in range,
 or DSK_ERR_SEEKFAIL otherwise.
 For a floppy driver, only implement this function if your FDC can perform
 a seek by itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_xread, dc_xwrite 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_xread)(DSK_PDRIVER self, const DSK_GEOMETRY *geom, void *buf,
 dsk_pcyl_t cylinder, dsk_phead_t head, dsk_pcyl_t cyl_expected, dsk_phead_t
 head_expected, dsk_psect_t sector, size_t bytes_to_write, int *deleted);
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_xwrite)(DSK_PDRIVER self, const DSK_GEOMETRY *geom, const
 void *buf, dsk_pcyl_t cylinder, dsk_phead_t head, dsk_pcyl_t cyl_expected,
 dsk_phead_t head_expected, dsk_psect_t sector, size_t bytes_to_read, int
 *deleted);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Read / write sector whose ID may not match its position on disc, or which
 is marked as deleted.
 Only implement this if your disc image emulates sector IDs or your floppy
 driver exposes this level of functionality.
 Currently it is implemented in the Linux, NTWDM and CPCEMU drivers, plus
 those using LDBS as their internal storage (LDBS itself, DSK, EDSK, ApriDisk,
 CFI, JV3, CopyQM, QRST, Teledisk).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_status 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_status)(DSK_PDRIVER self, const DSK_GEOMETRY &geom, dsk_phead_t
 head, unsigned char *result); 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Return the drive status (see dsk_drive_status() for the bits to return).
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

*result
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will contain the value calculated by the default implementation; for most
 image file drivers, all you have to do is set the read-only bit if appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_tread 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_tread)(DSK_PDRIVER self, const DSK_GEOMETRY *geom, void *buf,
 dsk_pcyl_t cylinder, dsk_phead_t head);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Read a track.
 You need only implement this if your floppy driver exposes the relevant
 functionality; if you don't, the library will use multiple calls to dc_read()
 instead.
 This function has the same parameters and return values as dsk_ptread().
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_xtread
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_xread)(DSK_PDRIVER self, const DSK_GEOMETRY *geom, void *buf,
 dsk_pcyl_t cylinder, dsk_phead_t head, dsk_pcyl_t cyl_expected, dsk_phead_t
 head_expected);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Read a track, with extended sector matching (sector headers on disc differ
 from physical location).
 This function has the same parameters and return values as dsk_xtread().
 As with dc_tread(), you need only implement this function if your floppy
 driver has a special READ TRACK command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_option_enum
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_option_enum)(DSK_DRIVER *self, int idx, char **optname);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
List numerical options which your driver supports.
 If your driver does not support any, you need not implement this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_option_set, dc_option_get
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_option_set)(DSK_DRIVER *self, const char *optname, int value);
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_option_get)(DSK_DRIVER *self, const char *optname, int *value);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Get or set the value of a numerical option.
 Again, if your driver has no numerical options, this need not be implemented.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that numerical options can 'belong' either to a driver or to the LibDsk
 core, with the driver taking priority.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If LibDsk accesses a FAT-format disc image using the 'dsk' driver, neither
 LibDsk nor the driver will support the FS:CP/M:BSH option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If LibDsk accesses a CP/M-format disc image using the 'dsk' driver, dsk_get_geom
etry() will detect the CP/M filesystem.
 Since the driver does not support the FS:CP/M:BSH option, it will be handled
 by the LibDsk core.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If LibDsk accesses a CP/M-format disc image using the 'ydsk' driver, the
 driver does support the FS:CP/M:BSH option and so it will be handled by
 the driver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible for a driver to rely on the option support in the LibDsk
 core rather than implement its own.
 This means a lot less code needs to be written; but it does not allow any
 validation to be performed on the values an option can hold, nor does it
 notify the driver when the value of an option is changed.
 Currently this system is used by the myz80 driver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use this system, create the variables you require with dsk_isetoption:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t dsk_isetoption(DSK_DRIVER *self, const char *optname, int value,
 int create);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first three parameters are the same as for dsk_set_option().
 The last should be set to 1 to create the new variable, or 0 to return
 DSK_ERR_BADOPT if the variable is not present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To read a value back, use dsk_get_option() as normal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_trackids
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_trackids)(DSK_DRIVER *self,  const DSK_GEOMETRY *geom, dsk_pcyl_t
 cylinder, dsk_phead_t head, dsk_psect_t *count, DSK_FORMAT **result);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Read the IDs of all sectors on the specified track, preferably in the correct
 order and starting at the index hole.
 If you leave this function pointer as NULL, LibDsk will use a default implement
ation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_rtread
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_rtread)(DSK_DRIVER *self, const DSK_GEOMETRY *geom, void
 *buf, dsk_pcyl_t cylinder,  dsk_phead_t head, int reserved);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For future expansion.
 Leave this function pointer as NULL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_to_ldbs
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_to_ldbs)(DSK_DRIVER *self, struct ldbs **result, DSK_GEOMETRY
 *geom);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Export the current disk image file as an LDBS blockstore.
 If this driver is not for a disk image file, there's no need to implement
 this function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_from_ldbs
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_from_ldbs)(DSK_DRIVER *self, struct ldbs *source, DSK_GEOMETRY
 *geom);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Replace the entire contents of this disk image with the provided LDBS blockstore.
 If this driver is not for a disk image file, there's no need to implement
 this function.
\end_layout

Writing new drivers (derived from LDBS)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The technique when creating an LDBS-based driver is similar to a standalone
 driver, with a few important differences.
 A good example file to look at for this is the QRST driver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An LDBS-based driver will need to make extensive use of the functions in
 
\family typewriter
lib/ldbs.h
\family default
.
 Currently the best documentation for these functions is in the comments
 of 
\family typewriter
ldbs.h
\family default
 itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The driver header 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for a standalone driver, create a header, basing it on (for example)
 
\family typewriter
lib/drvqrst.h

 The first thing in the header (after the LGPL banner) is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

    unsigned long qrst_checksum; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
} QRST_DSK_DRIVER;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The major difference here is that the first member of the structure is a
 
\family typewriter
LDBSDISK_DSK_DRIVER
\family default
 rather than a plain 
\family typewriter
DSK_DRIVER
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The driver source file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, create a .c file for your driver.
 Again, it's probably easiest to base this on 
\family typewriter
lib/drvqrst.
\family default
c.
 At the start of this file, create a DRV_CLASS structure, such as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
DRV_CLASS dc_qrst = 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
{ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    sizeof(QRST_DSK_DRIVER), 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    &dc_ldbsdisk,

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    qrst_creat, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    qrst_close 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
}; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first four entries in this structure are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The size of your driver's instance data; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The driver's superclass.
 This needs to be set to 
\family typewriter
&dc_ldbsdisk
\family default
, rather than NULL as it would be in a standalone driver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The driver's name (as passed to 
\family typewriter
dsk_open()
\family default
 / 
\family typewriter
dsk_creat()
\family default
 ) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The driver's description string.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of the structure is composed of function pointers, but you
 should only need to provide the first three pointers (*_open, *_creat and
 *_close).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have created this structure, edit: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
drivers.h.
 Add a declaration for your DRV_CLASS structure, such as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
extern DRV_CLASS dc_myformat; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
drivers.inc.
 Insert a reference to your structure (eg: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
&dc_myformat,
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) in the list.
 Note that order is important; the comments in drivers.inc describe how to
 decide where things go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edit 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lib/Makefile.am
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Near the top of this file is a list of drivers and their header files;
 just add your .c and .h to this list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your driver depends on certain system headers (as all the floppy drivers
 do) then you will need to add checks for these to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

configure.in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lib/drvi.h
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; then run 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

autoconf
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to rebuild the configure script.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The function pointers in the DRV_CLASS structure are described in drv.h.
 The first parameter to all of them (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) is declared as a pointer to DSK_DRIVER.
 In fact, it is a pointer to the first member of your instance data structure.
 Just cast the pointer to the correct type:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
/* Sanity check: Is this meant for our driver? */ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
if (self->dr_class != &dc_qrst) return DSK_ERR_BADPTR; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
qrstself = (QRST_DSK_DRIVER *)self;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and you're in business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Driver functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_open
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_open )(DSK_PDRIVER self, const char *filename)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open a disc image and load it into an LDBS blockstore.
 Entered with: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 points to the instance data for this disc image (see above); it will have
 been initialised to zeroes using memset().
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

filename
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the name of the image to open.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Return: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
DSK_ERR_OK: The driver has successfully opened the image.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
DSK_ERR_NOTME: The driver cannot handle this image.
 Other drivers should be allowed to try to use it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
other: The driver cannot handle this image.
 No other drivers should be tried (eg: the image was recognised by this
 driver, but is corrupt).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have established that your driver can open and parse the image
 it was passed, it should initialise the LDBS blockstore in the superclass,
 using 
\family typewriter
ldbs_new()
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t ldbs_new(PLDBS *result, const char *filename, const char type[4]);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, the first parameter should point to the blockstore in the
 superclass.
 The other two should be NULL and LDBS_DSK_TYPE respectively:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
ldbs_new(&qrself->qrst_super.ld_store, NULL, LDBS_DSK_TYPE);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You then need to read in the entire disc image and save it in the blockstore
 using LDBS functions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For each track, use 
\family typewriter
ldbs_trackhead_alloc()
\family default
 to create a track header structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For each sector in that track, use 
\family typewriter
ldbs_encode_secid()
\family default
 to generate its block ID, then 
\family typewriter
ldbs_putblock()
\family default
 to add it to the store.
 Record the block ID in that sector's entry in the track header.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Once all the sectors have been added, use 
\family typewriter
ldbs_put_trackhead()
\family default
 to add the completed track header.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the file has a comment, record it using 
\family typewriter
ldbs_put_comment() 
\family default
rather than
\family typewriter
 dsk_set_comment().

\family default
 If your disc image has a fixed geometry you should convert it to a 
\family typewriter
DSK_GEOMETRY
\family default
 structure and record it with 
\family typewriter
ldbs_put_geometry()
\family default
.
 A few disc image formats contain a CP/M Disk Parameter block; if yours
 is one you should add that with 
\family typewriter
ldbs_put_dpb()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the blockstore is completely populated, end with 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
return ldbsdisk_attach(self); 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_creat
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_creat)(DSK_PDRIVER self, const char *filename)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This should check that the target file can be created, and keep hold of
 either its filename or file handle.
 It should then behave as 'open', except that you don't do anything with
 the blockstore created by 
\family typewriter
ldbs_new()
\family default
 before calling 
\family typewriter
ldbsdisk_attach().

\family default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
dc_close
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*dc_close)(DSK_PDRIVER self)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Close the disc image.
 If it has been changed, you need to write out the contents of the blockstore
 to a new file, overwriting anything that was there already.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thing to do (after basic sanity checks) is to call 
\family typewriter
ldbsdisk_detach()
\family default
 to ensure all pending buffers have been written to the blockstore.
 The next is to check if any changes need to be written back; if 
\family typewriter
self->dr_dirty
\family default
 is zero, there's nothing to write back, so you can just close the blockstore
 and return.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
return ldbs_close(&qrself->qrst_super.ld_store);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that changes do need to be written back, you now need to reverse
 the conversion done by your 'open' method, and write the blockstore out
 in the your disc image format.
 Some functions which may be helpful here are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ldbs_max_cyl_head()
\family default
 will return the number of cylinders and heads necessary to contain this
 disc image.
 For example, a 720k DOS disc image would return 80 cylinders, 2 heads.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ldbs_get_stats()
\family default
 will analyse the blockstore and return the maximum and minimum values for
 cylinder, head, sector, sectors per track and sector size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ldbs_all_tracks()
\family default
 will iterate over all tracks in the blockstore and, for each track, call
 a callback function you provide.
 It can return the tracks in SIDES_ALT, SIDES_OUTOUT or SIDES_OUTBACK order;
 if you want to process them in a different order you'll need to write your
 own iteration function.
 In that case, use 
\family typewriter
ldbs_max_cyl_head()
\family default
 to get the range, and then 
\family typewriter
ldbs_get_trackhead()
\family default
 for each track you want to process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ldbs_all_sectors()
\family default
 works on the same principle, but the callback is run for each sector in
 each track.
 Note that sectors will be returned in the order they are listed in the
 track header, which may well be different from their numerical order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ldbs_getblock()
\family default
 will load a sector using the block ID given for it in the track header.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ldbs_get_comment()
\family default
 will return the comment (if any).
 Similarly 
\family typewriter
ldbs_get_dpb()
\family default
 retrieves the CP/M DPB (if one was written) and 
\family typewriter
ldbs_get_geom()
\family default
 returns the DSK_GEOMETRY last used to format a track.
 Note that the geometry recorded is advisory; if it conflicts with the values
 returned by 
\family typewriter
ldbs_get_stats()
\family default
, the values returned by 
\family typewriter
ldbs_get_stats()
\family default
 are going to be the accurate ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ldbs_load_track()
\family default
 will return a memory buffer containing the data from all the sectors in
 a particular track, in sector ID order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
*_close()
\family default
 will be the last call your driver will receive for a given disc image file,
 and it should free any resources it is using.
 Whether it returns DSK_ERR_OK or an error, this disc image will not be
 used again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Adding new compression methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adding a new compression method is very similar to adding a driver, though
 you only have to implement four functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To add a new driver, you create a new COMPRESS_CLASS structure and add it
 to various files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Driver header 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is done as for disc drivers.
 If you don't need any extra variables (for example, gzip and bzip2 compression
 don't) then you don't have to declare a new structure type - see lib/compgz.h
 for an example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Driver implementation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, create a .c file for your driver.
 It's probably easiest to base this on lib/compgz.c.
 At the start of this file, create a COMPRESS_CLASS structure, such as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
COMPRESS_CLASS cc_gz = 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
{ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    sizeof(COMPRESS_DATA), 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    "gz", 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    "Gzip (deflate compression)", 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    gz_open, /* open */ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    gz_creat, /* create new */ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    gz_commit, /* commit */ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    gz_abort /* abort */ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
};
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first three entries in this structure are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The size of your driver's instance data.
 The GZip driver has no instance data and so just uses COMPRESS_DATA.
 If it had extra data these would be in a struct called GZ_COMPRESS_DATA,
 so the size here would be sizeof(GZ_COMPRESS_DATA).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The driver's name (as passed to dsk_open() / dsk_creat() ) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The driver's description string.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of the structure is composed of function pointers.
 The types of these are given in drv.h.
 You must implement all four.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have created this structure, edit: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
comp.h.
 Include your header.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
compress.inc.
 Insert a reference to your structure (eg: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

&cc_myzip,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) in the list.
 Note that order is important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edit 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lib/Makefile.am

 At the bottom of this file is a list of drivers and their header files;
 just add your .c and .h to this list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your driver depends on certain system headers (eg, the gzip one depends
 on zlib.h) then you will need to add checks for these to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

configure.in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; then run 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

autoconf
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to rebuild the configure script.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The function pointers in the COMPRESS_CLASS structure are described in lib/compr
ess.h.
 The first parameter to all of them (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) is declared as a pointer to COMPRESS_DATA.
 In fact, it is a pointer to the first member of your instance data structure.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
cc_open 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*cc_open )(COMPRESS_DATA *self)

\begin_layout Standard
Attempt to decompress a compressed file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
self->cd_cfilename is the filename of the file to decompress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Return: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
DSK_ERR_OK: The file has been decompressed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
DSK_ERR_NOTME: The file is not compressed using this driver's method.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
other: The file does belong to this driver, but it is corrupt or some other
 error occurred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two helper functions may be useful when you are writing cc_open:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t comp_fopen(COMPRESS_DATA *self, FILE **pfp);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open the the file whose name is given at 
\family typewriter
self->cd_cfilename
\family default

 If successful, 
\family typewriter
*pfp
\family default
 will be the opened stream.
 If not, it will be NULL.
 If the file can only be opened read-only, sets 
\family typewriter
self->cd_readonly
\family default
 to 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t comp_mktemp(COMPRESS_DATA *self, FILE **pfp);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Create a temporary file and store its name at 
\family typewriter
self->cd_ufilename
\family default

 You should use this to create the file that you decompress into.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
cc_creat
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*cc_creat)(COMPRESS_DATA *cd)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Warn the compression engine that a disc image file is being created, and
 when closed it will be compressed.
 The filename is stored at 
\family typewriter
self->cd_cfilename
\family default
.
 Normally this just returns DSK_ERR_OK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
cc_commit
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*cc_commit)(COMPRESS_DATA *cd)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compress an uncompressed file.
 
\family typewriter
self->cd_ufilename
\family default
 is the name of the file to compress.
 
\family typewriter
self->cd_cfilename

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
cc_abort 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dsk_err_t (*cc_abort)(COMPRESS_DATA *cd)

\begin_layout Standard
This is used if a file was decompressed and it's now being closed without

 There is therefore no need to compress it again.
 This normally just returns DSK_ERR_OK.

\begin_layout Standard
Adding a new remote transport is also very similar to adding a driver.

\begin_layout Description
input is the packet LibDsk wants to send.

\begin_layout Description
inp_len is the number of bytes in the packet.

\begin_layout Description
output is a buffer for the result packet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
*out_len (on entry) is the size of the result buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
*out_len (on return) is the number of bytes that were populated in the result
 buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, this call will wrap the input in whatever framing bytes are
 necessary (usually including the packet length, since packets do not contain
 their own length), send the packet over the wire, wait for a response,
 and unpack the response into 'output'.
 Return DSK_ERR_TIMEOUT if the connection timed out (the 'serial' driver
 waits 30 seconds) and DSK_ERR_ABORT if the user deliberately broke the
 connection.

The CopyQM File Format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes the file format of files created by CopyQM.
 A lot of the information has been extracted by looking at hex-dumps of
 the files, so there might be some errors in the description.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Header
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CopyQM files consist of a header, an optional comment (if indicated
 by the header) followed by the tracks of the image encoded with a run length
 encoding scheme.
 The header is 133 bytes long, see table.
 It always starts with {0x43, 0x51, 0x14 }, which can be used for auto-detection
 of the image.
 All numbers have little-endian byte ordering.
 When all bytes in the header are added together in a byte, the result should
 be zero.

\begin_layout Subsection
CRC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CRC is calculated for the unpacked data for all tracks that are used
 in the image.
 The CRC value is initialized with 0 and then updated using the CRC 32 polynomia
l 0x104C11DB7, bit reverse algorithm.
 Due to a feature in CopyQM (8 bit register as an index into a 1024 byte
 table) all bytes must have their top two bits removed before added to the
 CRC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Image comment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The image comment follows the header.
 It has a variable size found in the header.
 The image comment can contain 
\backslash
0-bytes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Image data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The image data is run length encoded.
 Each run is preceded by a 16-bit length.
 If the length is negative, the byte after the length is repeated 
\series bold
-length
\series default
 times.
 If the length is positive, it is followed by 
\series bold
length
\series default
 bytes of unencoded data.
 It seems like a new run of repeating or differing data is always started
 at each new track.
 Older versions of CopyQM always alternates between runs of differing data
 and repeating data, even if the length of one of them is zero.

DQK Files 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A DQK file is a .DSK file compressed using Richard Greenlaw's Squeeze file
 format (originally from CP/M as SQ.COM, and later built in to NSWP.COM; versions
 also exist for DOS and UNIX).
 SQ was used in preference to more efficient compressors such as gzip because
 it can be readily decoded on 8-bit and 16-bit computers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original reason for DQK files was software distribution.
 A disc image of a 180k disc won't fit on a 180k disc, owing to various
 overheads.
 However, the compressed DQK version may fit onto such a disc, and leave
 room for a tool to write the DQK back out as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a tool has been included in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dskwrite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 directory in this distribution.
 It contains the following files:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
dskwrite.com: Program to write .DSK or .DQK files out to a real disc.
 The .COM file works on PCs, Amstrad PCWs and Sinclair Spectrum +3s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
dskwrite.txt: Documentation for dskwrite.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
dskwrite.z80: Z80 source for the CP/M version.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
dskwrite.asm: 8086 source for the DOS version.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
dskwrsea.com: The dskwrite distribution file - a self-extracting archive.
 It will self-extract under CP/M or DOS.

LibDsk with cpmtools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
cpmtools v1.9 and later <http://www.moria.de/~michael/cpmtools/> can be configured
 to use LibDsk for all disc access, thus allowing CP/M discs and emulator
 disc images to be read and written.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
cpmtools v2.19+ allow a cpmtools disk definition to be associated with a
 LibDsk geometry, by adding a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

libdsk:format
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 entry to the disk definition.
 For example, this entry uses 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

libdsk:format ibm1440
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so that the disk image is accessed using the 'ibm1440' geometry rather
 than the default 'pcw1440'.

DSK / EDSK recording mode extension

This extension was proposed by me on the comp.sys.sinclair and comp.sys.amstrad.8bit
 newsgroups on 10 January 2004.
 It was subsequently released in ANNE 2.1.4 and added to the formal EDSK format
 definition at <http://andercheran.aiind.upv.es/~amstrad/docs/extdsk.html

>.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DSK/EDSK originate on the Amstrad CPC, which ordinarily writes all its diskettes
 in MFM recording mode and at the Double Density rate.
 However, ANNE emulates the PcW16, which also supports the High Density
 rate; and the system software depends on DD discs not being readable at
 the HD rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extension gives meanings to two unused bytes of the DSK/EDSK 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 block:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*

\begin_layout Description
1 Single or Double Density (180k, 720k, etc.)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\begin_layout Description

\begin_layout Description

\begin_layout Description
2 MFM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Existing files should have zeroes in these bytes; hence the use of 0 for
 Unknown.
 LibDsk will guess the values in if the ones in the file are zero.
